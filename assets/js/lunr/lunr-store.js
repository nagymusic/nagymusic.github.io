        "excerpt":"Carmen Perpetuum For string orchestra (2017) 15’ Published by Universal Edition.   Program Note   Taking its title from the beginning of Ovid’s ”Metamorphoses,” Carmen Perpetuum, or ”unbroken song,” unfolds into two contrasting sections. The first section introduces a somewhat meditative character in moderate tempo, gradually increasing in intensity, followed by a fast and unceasing motto perpetuo section. In the beginning, a melodic-harmonic line serves as the underpinning for the entire piece, accumulating the musical energy throughout the first section of the composition to eventually produce something new and highly energetic at the end. The musical material employed in the piece was initially featured in the first movement from Two Canons for organ solo (2007, rev. 2017). However, what unites the piece musically is a constantly recurring melody, spiral-like canons embracing the cantus firmus that, to quote Gabrielle Starr in her book Feeling Beauty (2013), becomes ”a song never-ending in its transformation and evolution” (146). Cantabilamente For orchestra (3-3-3-3, 4-3-3-3, timp, perc(3), hp, strings)(2017) 13’   Program Note   Cantabilamente takes its title and musical material from a fragment of glagolitic chant from the Island of Hvar in Croatia. Known as a unique collection of folk melodies intended as religious lamentations, the glagolitic chant offers a particular type of musical material suggestive of contemplative musical space. The piece begins and ends with a prologue and epilogue that unfolds a litany of melodic iterations. This process suggests a ritual-like structure whereby the ensuing presentation of musical material embodies a procession-like experience comprised of the continuous transformations of orchestral textures and instrumental colors. The transparent overtones of lament coalesce into the resonance of emotional intensity, ranging from the dark and expressive sustained lines, opaque and suspended at times, to the bright and solemn exuberance of the dense sonorities. Cord[echo]es For violin and orchestra (2-2-2-2, 2, 3, 2, 1, timp, perc(3), vln, strings (2012, rev. 2017) 15’   Program Note   Cord[echo]es is a ritual-like, ceremonial concerto for violin and chamber orchestra based on Bach’s Chaconne in d minor from Partita no. 2 for solo violin, BWV 1004. The piece is based on a continuous process of gradual transformation from a significantly modified manifestations of Bach’s chaconne to its brief quotation in the cadenza. The form of the concerto can best be described as a spiral: the prologue and epilogue that open and close the work enclose the reinstatements (commentaries and couplets) of the two contrasting sections that unfold and move the music forward. Qualia Sinfonia concertante for organ, harp, timpani and strings (2015) 15’ Published by Universal Edition.   Program Note   As a sinfonia concertante for organ, string orchestra, harp, and timpani, Qualia takes as inspiration the notion of our inner sense perceptions, also known as 'qualia,' a term used in the philosophy and psychology of to allude to discrete instances and qualities of conscious awareness, emotion, and experience. Envisioned as an organ concerto, Qualia is a musical representation of introspective affective states reflected through a dynamic array of evocative harmonies, melodies, rhythms, and textures. Angel Antiphons For chamber orchestra (1-1-1-1, 1-1-0-0, timp, perc(1), hp, strings)(2013) 8’ Published by Universal Edition. ORCHESTRA AND CONCERTOS by Zvonimir Nagy, composer  Program Note   Angel Antiphons was composed in honor of Benjamin Britten's birth centenary (1913-2013).The work can best be described as a joyous celebration of life and music. The musical material, which consists of two contrasting ideas, propels the spiral-like form whose formal and structural framework reveals ceremonial and ritual-like sections on one end, and more fluid and exuberant ones, on the other. The slower sections in the piece elaborate on a short melodic fragment taken from Britten's anthem for mixed choir and organ, Antiphon, composed in 1956.

Program Note   Influenced by traditional Asian religious practices and music performance, this evocation for shakuhachi and orchestra is inspired by ‘suizen’ — a blowing meditation; suizen is known as a form of Zen practice characterized by the ritual of playing the shakuhachi bamboo flute (a Japanese end-blown flute) as a means of achieving a state of self-realization. Suizen may be best described as a tone poem for orchestra — a sound image of the moments of inner reflection and musical experience. The instrumentation enhances this experience whereby the oscillations of harmonies, melodies, and rhythms resemble one’s breathing – the experience suggested in the opening and closing sections of the work.   Suizen received the 2011 Seattle Symphony Composition Prize \"Celebrate Asia Festival.\"   Performances   Seattle Symphony Orchestra; Stilian Kirov, conductor; Hanz Araki, shakuhachi flute.

INSTRUMENTAL ENSEMBLES by Zvonimir Nagy, composerINSTRUMENTAL ENSEMBLES by Zvonimir Nagy, composer  Program Note   Being my most personal piece to date, Anima Animae  depicts by musical means growth cycles of the human life, in part suggesting more spiritual ramifications of \"anima animae\" or the birth of \"a soul of the soul.\" The piece unfolds in two parts, with the second redefining the first's musical structure and form.

The Charlotte New Music Festival, Charlotte, NCThe Idol and the Ikon Oboe and vibraphone (2018) 8’ INSTRUMENTAL ENSEMBLES by Zvonimir Nagy, composer  Program Note   The Idol and the Ikon takes its title from a chapter of the same name found in the book, God Without Being by the French philosopher and theologian, Jean-Luc Marion. The piece gradually unfolds in two sections, creating mirror images of recursive perspectives that coalesce into a steady intent of listening experience. As Marion puts it, \"What characterizes the material idol is precisely that the artist can consign to it the subjugating brilliance of a first visible; on the contrary, what characterizes the icon painted on wood does not come from the hand of a man but from the infinite depth that crosses it—or better, orients it following the intention of a gaze.\" (God Without Being, p. 21)   Performances   May 2018 - Dylan Evers, oboe; Paulina Michaels, vibraphone.

In the beginning, a melodic-harmonic line serves as the underpinning for the entire piece, accumulating the musical energy throughout the first section of the piece, to eventually produce something new and extremely energetic at the end. The musical material employed in the piece was originally featured in the first movement from Two Canons for organ (2007, rev. 2017). What unites the piece musically is a constantly recurring melody, spiral-like canons embracing the cantus firmus that, to quote Gabrielle Starr in her book Feeling Beauty (2013), becomes \"a song never ending in its transformation and evolution\" (146). Fall, Leaves, Fall String quartet (2016) 8’ INSTRUMENTAL ENSEMBLES by Zvonimir Nagy, composer  Program Note   A cavatina for string quartet, Fall, Leaves, Fall resonates an inward sentiment suggested by hushed but expressive thematic writing and discrete harmonic language. Evocative in nature, the piece unfolds a series of episodes that build energy and forward movement, while at the same time preserving the intimate mood of melodic gestalt on its elegiac course. The fragile and delicate sense of continuity is contrasted by fragmentary trepidation, framing timeless moments of serene expectation. Fall, Leaves, Fall, was inspired by a poem by Emily Brontë that encapsulates the emotional struggle for a sense of belonging and the nostalgic acceptance of new cultures, places, realities ...

Crossing Borders Music Initiative: Honoring Refugee Composers, St. James Cathedral, Chicago, IL   Liquescence Alto flute, English horn, and bass clarinet (2015, rev. 2016) 13’   Program Note   Conceived as a series of sonic images, Liquescence is based entirely on a simple harmonic phrase using only five pitches and a fixed durational matrix. Throughout the piece, each phrase is systematically rotated, while additional, contrapuntal lines are gradually superimposed onto the fixed harmonic space. While the static nature of the music becomes apparent, the music unfolds a range of textures and subsidiary melodic figures that are produced by an extensive exploration of the timbral possibilities of the given instrumental ensemble.

Recursive patterns of harmonies and emerging melodies, along with the interactive contrapuntal symmetries between the instruments, suggest the refractory patterns of light formed by mirrors containing pieces of colored glass, such as those found in a kaleidoscope. This can be heard where patterns of musical shapes emerge that invite the listener to enter an Escher-like musical space.   Kaleidoscope was commissioned by Elisa Elisa Järvi and Andrea Kiefer.

Helsinki Music Centre, Helsinki, FinlandEpigram Variations Four cellos (2014) 11’ Published by Universal Edition.   Program Note   Largely based on Bach’s Prelude from Cello Suite no. 1 in G major, BWV 1007, and composed in part as an opposition to it, Epigram Variations offers a collage-like re-composition of the basic musical material extrapolated from Bach’s composition. By carefully examining consecutive musical motives and phrases from the original source, the so-called “theme” of the piece becomes gradually revealed in each consecutive variation. Through the systematic transformation of musical material, the composition de-constructs the musical past by offering retrospective instances of the newly composed narrative. As a result, the piece smoothly segues into an extemporaneous fantasy, culminating in visceral, ostinato-driven melodic and rhythmic lines.   Performances   February 2016 - Michael Lipman, David Premo, Bronwyn Barendt, Adam Liu, cellos (Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra). Duquesne University, Pittsburgh, PAEnchantments Four movements for piano trio (1999, rev. 2013) 15’ Published by MusikFabrik.   Program Note   Composed in 1999 and revised in 2013, Enchantments features four movements: I. Scattered Charms, II. Nocturne, III. Incantation, and IV. Valse Burlesque. These four character pieces offer a playful glimpse into my early works' exploration of chamber writing and musical narrative. The original version of the piece was entitled Piano Trio (1998/99) and was premiered by the Zagreb Piano Trio in 1999. While this initial version of the trio was also comprised of four movements, the present edition replaces the original fourth movement with a violin and piano piece titled Valse Burlesque, composed in 1998 – a fleeting musical postcard and humorous take on a Valse.   The music of Enchantments reflects an imaginary sound world portrayed in colorful harmonies and instrumentation. The given titles further suggest music imagery with percussive, pointillist flourishes, suspended tones, palpable melodic fragments, and decorative dissonances that entwine the transparency of melodic and rhythmic gestures. At times moving and cheerful, restrained and sentimental, and then resounding and rhythmic, the movements of Enchantments offer a great variety in their scoring. While it is suggested that movements two and three are performed consecutively attacca, movements one, three, and four can also be performed individually.

PNC Recital Hall, Duquesne University, Pittsburgh, PAAngel Annunciation Cello and Piano (2012) 15’ Published by Aldebaran Editions  Denys Lytvynenko - cello; Nataliya Martynova - piano   Program Note   Characterized by its large formal design, Angel Annunciation was inspired by a passage from an essay on Barnett Newman’s paintings from Jean-François Lyotard’s (1924-1998) essay, Newman: The Instant: “... it is an angel. It announces nothing; it is in itself an annunciation.” Resembling the unfolding of a spiral, the piece alternates between two contrasting ideas: a contemplative chorale delineated by a lament-like melody, followed by more flowing, rapidly alternating canons that echo the original musical material, creating a sense of mystery. The cello and piano parts complement each other by reinforcing the synergy found in the reciprocity of those two musical ideas. The work was dedicated in memoriam to the composer’s first composition teacher, the Croatian composer Marko Ruždjak (1946-2012).

Teach thine arms then to embrace,  And sweet  Rosy  Lips to kiss,  And mix our souls in mutual bliss.  Eyes were made for beauty’s grace,  Viewing,  Rueing  Love’s long pain,  Procured by beauty’s rude disdain.   Movement II  Come away, come, sweet Love!

BBC/Abedeen Composition Prize Concert, the University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, United Kingdomintimate stream[s] String quartet (2008, rev. 2011) 10’ INSTRUMENTAL ENSEMBLES by Zvonimir Nagy, composer  Program Note   intimate stream[s]  was inspired by ideas from Gestalt psychology and the psychoacoustical model of auditory streams, especially by the work of psychologist Albert Bregman. In theory, the study of auditory stream segregation deals with principles of organization of sound into perceptually coherent structures. In my composition, the idea portrays a single harmonic stream comprised of multiple melodic lines whose individual parts move from harmonicity to inharmonicity, resulting in the harmonic motion between tonal stability and instability.   This conceptual process enhances the musical flux and controls the varied statements of a single harmonic object. In turn, timbral variations not only enhance the melodic/harmonic contour of consonance and dissonance, but they also form an impression of evolving harmonic envelopes whose dynamic curves accompany time-varying contrapuntal arabesques. The harmonic language in the piece reflects the beginning of my research in a personal harmonic grammar inspired by cognitive attributes of sound as a metaphor for musical syntax.   This string quartet also belongs to a group of my works in which I explore the interaction and reciprocity of consonance and dissonance and the uniformity and uniqueness of musical design as a direct narrative tool for portraying the musically sublime, best defined as simultaneity of tension and repose, and structural circularity and irresolvability, respectively.

Glassy Passage of an Icy Dream Violin, violoncello, clarinet and piano (2006) 7’   Program Note   A work for four instruments, Passage of an Icy Dream, is a result of my continuing study and exploration of harmony and resonance in which I envisaged a timbral field with constantly evolving instrumental textures. The structure of the work is everything but fixed: like in a dream – as we finally emerge into some virtual reality with events and objects in constant flux, we wake up keeping only a distant memory. The piece unfolds like a ritual of the inner awaking and meditation.   Performances   March 2006 - Richard Zili, cl; Zara Zaharieva, vln; Fabiana Aiko Mino, vlc; Mabel Kwan, pno.

While the melodic melismas in the work’s two main sections are composed on this principle, they are much freer in their design.  Their inner forms almost resemble the unfolding of a spiral, with each lattice, or phrase, based on various patterns of repetition and transformation: in the first section producing an effect of slowly evolving melodic appearances, and a ritualistic impression of driving dances in the second.

Just as the pattern seems to become predictable, another line enters the music, rubbing dissonantly against the first - a raindrop of the lake, perhaps, whose ripples now expand in a new direction, responding to new raindrops, forming new ripples. A consistent rhythmic pattern materializes from the intersecting lines, seducing the listener into the sensation of some sort of postminimalist groove, but only temporarily - soon those expectations evaporate, and other grooves fade in, just as in the movement of nature we cannot help but perceive a reflection of our own psychological habits and tendencies. The music's objectivity initially turns us back on ourselves, but if we continue to listen closely, we will find ourselves encouraged to return to the sounds themselves, and the underlying peace behind all of the movement may reval itself to us. The first etude ends on its way out, Ligeti-like, pointing toward the infinite expansion of the pattern beyond the edge of the keyboard. The sonance series is used to similar effect in the the etude's two sequels: in of the lake II (2011), it produces a glittering surface of light, dancing waves, while of the lake III (2014) throws us immediately into a strong undertow and gradually brings us back to the shore.

        "excerpt":"crux Fixed multimedia (2022) 75’   Program Note   after Barnett Newman, The Stations of the Cross: Lema Sabachtani   In this series of pieces, I created a multi-layered sound world whose musical gestures unfold as a series of musical canvases. I focused on shaping electronic sounds to embody a synergy between artwork and music.Similar to Newman's intention when creating his Stations of the Cross canvases, I, too, wanted my sonic stations \"to stand witness to the story of each man's agony: the agony that is single, constant, unrelenting, willed - a world without end.\" In composing the series, I sought to compile sound samples and filters that resonate with Newman's artwork and shape the form and structure, as well as the grouping of individual movements. mercy (remix) Fixed media (2022) 5’   Program Note   Based on mercy (2021) for unacompanied mixed choir. Toccare Virtualmente Disklavier (2019) 3’ cantusesquisse Fixed media (2019) 8’   Program Note   cantusesquisse features a series of processed and synthesized sound samples that originated in a short melodic chant-like audio sample. The result is a multilayered ambient stream of sound that while at times meditative, it invites the listener to enter into the sound itself by experiencing the unfolding of different sonic paths. Dialogues with Silence Flute, baritone, percussion and multimedia (2019) 60’ Dialogues with Silence by Zvonimir Nagy - composer  Program Note   As a recipient of the Duquesne University's 2017 Paluse Faculty Research Grant, I composed a new musical composition based on prayers and drawings from Dialogues with Silence (2001), a book by a Catholic priest and Trappist monk, Thomas Merton (1915—1968).   To explore the role of the sacred in the search for the common good, in composing my new musical composition I considered Merton's concept of silence as a contemplative agent for social change in our world. This necessity for inner reflection would be a guiding principle in the selection of texts and drawings to be featured in the composition, thus supporting the university’s concern for moral and spiritual values, as well as its attentiveness to social and global concerns.   TThe poems and prayers associated with the drawings played an essential role in the musical design of the work. In the treatment of the text, I used the words to determine the shape of selected movements in structural details, large and small, by translating the text into numerical sequences and transforming them into musical materials. I further sought to compile sound samples and filters that resonate with Merton's artwork and poetry, shape the form and structure, and the grouping of individual movements. Finally, I enhanced the vocal and instrumental writing by electronically manipulating sounds that act as a sonic backdrop to the selected drawings displayed during the performance. The new composition premiered in Spring of 2019 at the Genesius Theatre at Duquesne University. Concealments Fixed multimedia (2017) 11’   Program Note   Based on the encaustic handmade paper laminate artwork Concealment Series by Haley Nagy. Similar to “the fusion of encaustic and hand papermaking used to explore the idea of the ‘hidden,'” Concealments is a sound art piece explores the fusion of cultural forms emanating from the reciprocity of visual and sound arts. In this interdisciplinary collaborative project, I wanted to learn from the artist’s creative practice about how to approach texture of sound, and relate information about visual appearance in a musical work.  I. Unveil very fast, becoming translucent  II. Reveal calm, moving, pliable  III. Conceal very slow, evaporating  IV. Apparent exuberant and free, gradually receding  V. Veil very fast, becoming opaque Inner Self II Three clarinets and electronics (2015) 9’   Program Note   In Inner Self II, Nagy injects a new level of discipline into his quest for color. The interweaving patterns of strict contrapuntal imitation in this spiral canon unfold in diatonic purity throughout, creating an untroubled flow that invites us to pay fresh attention to each new juxtaposition of tones. Through the almost scientific process of canon, Nagy rediscovers and reassesses the intervals in the diatonic collection for their coloristic potential. (Benjamin Binder).   At times the electronic sounds extend the clarinet resonance; at other times the electronic part creates contrapuntal textures that complement the unfolding of the three-part canon in the clarinet part. This work is a sequel to Canon-Inner Self (2007) for piano solo.   Performances   April 2015 - Emily Cook, Caitlyn Stratman, Christina Blahnik, clarinets. Musicianship Creates. Duquesne University, Pittsburgh, PAKaleidoscope Piano, accordion, live electronics (2014, rev. 2015) 9’ Also version for two pianos   Program Note   Scored as a triptych, Kaleidoscope depicts self-sustaining musical transformations that coalesce into fluid, constantly evolving, mirage-like structures. Recursive patterns of harmonies and emerging melodies, along with the interactive contrapuntal symmetries between the instruments, suggest the refractory patterns of light formed by mirrors containing pieces of colored glass, such as those found in a kaleidoscope. This can be heard where patterns of musical shapes emerge that invite the listener to enter an Escher-like musical space.   Kaleidoscope was commissioned by Elisa Elisa Järvi and Andrea Kiefer.

Helsinki Music Centre, Helsinki, FinlandAnd so she said II Sound installation (2013) 8’   Program Note   In this sound installation, I used a recording of my wife's voice, whose vocal attributes were analyzed and transformed into a gradually evolving sonic canvas. Considering her short speech utterance to be the main sound object or leitmotif, I created a series of musical transformations of the original sound. This resulted in both a melodic and harmonic evolution of sound textures, where the transformations processes influenced a more polyphonic treatment of the material. The resulting design of the work may reassemble a spiral in which each consecutive transformation resound the vocal qualities of the voice, becoming multi-layered and intricate by each turn. And so she said... II is a sequel to a short piano piece composed after the spectral analysis of the sound material.

Recorded by the pianist Geoffrey Burleson at the Cleveland Composer’s Recording Institute, it is now available for download on iTunes. The recording was made possible by the grant from St. Xavier University and support from Ms. Nancy Joyce of Chicago. As a sequel to an earlier piano piece, …of the lake I, this work also continues to explore the concept of a étude from the perspective of both performance and composition. The pianistic technique and compositional design in … of the lake II is structured around the notion of a constantly changing appearance of musical harmony, rhythm, texture, and piano resonance. The piece resembles the surface of a lake or sea that gradually transforms itself by arriving to the shore: as the morphing of the water’s waves embraces a physical constraint imposed by the shore, sand, and stone, the music of this piano work finds meaning in a gradual transformation of wave-like musical gestures and melodic fragments within a clearly predefined tonal and metric palette. This ongoing series of piano etudes is inspired by Lake Michigan and my neighborhood of Rogers Park in Chicago. While composing the piece, I was interested in capturing the wave-like perceptual attractions between different pitches, causing the listener to establish very clear melodic and metric expectations and grouping schemas. The result is an emotional plethora of evolving melodic lines and more or less fulfilled anticipations of their growth and decay.

The glittering case reflects the colorful and inviting performance space - a part of the Center for Social Action Through Music, designed by the Venezuelan architect, Tomás Lugo. Music thrives in this place, led by a passionate group of fantastic musicians and of course, imbued with the enthusiasm of the country’s very own, Gustavo Dudamel. The organ stop-list reveals the Spanish influence with the indispensable set of horizontally mounted high-pressured Trompeta de Batalla. My favorite two were Gamba and Voz Celeste, while harmonically lush and and delightfully stringy, would only resonate more mysteriously if placed in a large reverb-prone edifice of some sacred affiliation.

        "excerpt":"My paper Derivation of Pitch Constructs From the Principles of Tone Perception was featured at the 12th International Conference on Music Perception and Cognition (ICMPC) and 8th Triennial Conference of the European Society for the Cognitive Sciences of Music (ESCOM). The conference is organized by the Department of Music Studies, School of Fine Arts, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece, and the European Society for the Cognitive Sciences of Music. The conference took place on July 23-28, 2012. Paper Abstract      Derivation of Pitch Constructs from the Principles of Tone Perception   Recent cross-cultural studies in psychoacoustics, cognitive music theory, and neuroscience of music have suggested a direct correlation between the spectral content found in tones of musical instruments and the human voice on the formation of musical material, such as intervals, scales, modes, and chords.  From an interdisciplinary point of view, the paper surveys important concepts that have contributed to the perception and understanding of musical harmony: pitch, consonance and dissonance, intervals, and chords.  The theoretical model for pitch constructs is derived from the perceptual attributes of musical tones, notably from the pattern of tone intervals found within the spectra of pitched tones.  Based on the psychological and biological properties of the auditory system and related cognitive systems, the model is based on the intrinsic hierarchy of vertical intervals and their relationships within harmonic sound spectrum.  As catalysts for both melody and harmony, instances of musical scales of varying number of pitches within the 12-tone chromatic scale are classified.  The model’s potential for generation of chords of various degrees of harmonic affinity is described and its compatibility with Western music theory suggested.  This leads to a vertical aspect of musical harmony by bonding of the intervallic quality and their intrinsic structure embedded in the very tones that produce them.  The model’s application in the construction of tone systems puts forward a rich discourse between music acoustics, perception, and cognition on one end, and music theory, aesthetics, and music composition on the other.

I am thankful to musicians from Trio Jónio: Ana Isabel Rei (flute), João Diogo Pereira (violin), and Luis Gomes dos Santos (piano). The festival also featured by paper Spatiality in Music: the Spiral as a Metaphor for Musical Form, also published in the Unidade de Investigação em Música e Musicologia proceedings. The completion of this project has been generously supported by the Musicianship Department at the Mary Pappert School of Music at Duquesne University. The International Meeting for Chamber Music has two main objectives: to encourage alumni of the University of Évora Music Department into scientific initiation and their artistic expansion toward contemporary music, and to promote the international dialogue among contemporary composers and their performers. Paper Abstract      Spatiality in Music: the Spiral as a Metaphor for Musical Form   From an interdisciplinary perspective, the paper investigates certain aspects of musical space in formation of form and structure in musical composition. The study offers a cross-disciplinary approach to the derivation of structural processes and formal design: it deconstructs the notion of musical form as both object and process, and offers a paradigm of a spiral and its formal and structural implications. The paper describes the fundamental premise of the formation of spirals as the main carrier of musical form; it presents an argument that musical form may be imagined as an extension of the multi-dimensional spatial principles found in nature, geometry, and architecture. The transformative processes common to the structure of spirals and their application in musical form are explained, followed by a formal analysis of my recent collection of organ etudes. The paper puts forward an analytical representation of the spatiality of musical form and structure. ","categories": ["composition","research"],

The conference seeks to explore the aesthetic, liturgical, theoretical, and technical principles of Tournemire’s improvisations and teachings on improvisation, the use of Gregorian chant in organ improvisation, the role of organ improvisations in the Catholic liturgy, and pedagogical approaches to teaching organ improvisation. The conference will include liturgies, opportunities for the study of improvisation at the organ, recital programs and papers relating to the conference theme. I will present a lecture/recital during the symposium at Calvary Episcopal Church in Pittsburgh. The topic of my presentation is “Performance as Ritual; Creation as Prayer.” Paper Abstract      Performance as Ritual - Creation as Prayer   Traditionally, musical composition and performance have been understood as a realization of preconceived musical structures that through the perceptual and cognitive processes of replication or invention are presented either in real time (performance) or over an extended period of time (composition). From an interdisciplinary perspective, however, the nature of musical creativity may suggest further emotional and musical representations of specific, freely associated experiences construed by the composer or performer. When this occurs, the music’s distinct character can be appreciated as musical ritual, in terms of an induced spiritual ethos, rather than a mere execution of idiomatically constructed musical sequences.     This lecture draws on the relationships between the ritualistic attributes of musical performance – described in terms of symbolic and stylized acts or actions – and musical creation that is understood as one’s enactment of contemplation or prayer.  It defines musical invention as a creative spiritual process; it draws on the relationship between the two attributes of musical creation: the cognitive and performative ones described in terms of symbolic and stylized acts or actions controlled and sustained by the cognitive nervous system, and the emotional and spiritual attributes that may be understood as the mind’s enactment of musical contemplation or prayer.    The importance and legacy of Charles Tournemire and his enduring impact on the art of organ music, along with present-day observations on the structure of music performance, psychoanalysis, and religious experience, suggest a direct link between performance and contemplation. The motives of mysticism that permeate the organ compositions of Franck, Tournemire, and Messiaen are used to develop the aesthetics of musical creativity in the performing arts using the notions of prayer and performance as mutually inclusive idiosyncrasies of the musical and spiritual experience evoked thereof. A brief discussion and performance of the author’s meditations for organ solo, Preludes for a Prayer&lt;/i, concludes the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Registration is now open!

Music can help us apperceive the sense of our inner being as well as encounter the divine in some beautifully mysterious ways.

The nature of musical performance can also be appreciated as musical ritual, in terms of an induced spiritual ethos, rather than a mere execution of idiomatically constructed musical sequences. As a composer and organist, I investigate the notion of the religious in musical performance as experienced by both the performer and listener. As a result, the introspective setting of the presented repertoire invites one to contemplate the structure and meaning of prayer through sound, as portrayed by musical themes and gestures.

The Competition seeks to promote and recognize emerging composers who are interested in Asian culture, music and traditions. Suizen, a symphonic evocation for shakuhachi flute and orchestra (2012) received the world premiere performance by the Seattle Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Stilian Kirov, and Hanz Araki on the shakuhachi flute. The premiere performance took place at the Seattle Symphony’s Benaroya Hall on Sunday, January 27, 2013. Influenced by traditional Asian religious practices and music performance, this evocation for shakuhachi and orchestra is inspired by ‘suizen’ – a blowing meditation; suizen is known as a form of Zen meditative practice characterized by the ritual of playing the shakuhachi bamboo flute (a Japanese end-blown flute) as a means of achieving a state of self-realization. Suizen can be best described as a tone poem for orchestra – a sound image of the moments of inner reflection and musical experience. The instrumentation enhances this experience whereby the oscillations of harmonies, melodies, and rhythms resemble one’s breathing – the experienced suggested in the opening and closing sections of the work.

Paper Abstract      From Soul-within Sound-to Self    Recent studies in music perception, neuroscience, psychology, and religion suggest a direct correlation between musical sound and spirituality. Here I define sound production and realization as creative spiritual processes forming a relationship between two attributes of musical creation: the cognitive and performative ones described in terms of symbolic and stylized acts or actions controlled and sustained by the cognitive nervous system, and the emotional and spiritual attributes that may be understood as the mind’s enactment of musical contemplation or prayer. From an interdisciplinary point of view, the paper speculates that when hearing musical sounds our consciousness may be mapped in the brain, resulting in specific cognitive pathways that may account for the sense of our inner self. As a result, the paper describes musical creativity as a form of self-realization – a discovery and manifestation of the existence of an authentic self.This activity is effectuated by mental, psychological, or spiritual introspection as it forms a direct link between musical sound and our inner self. The paper puts forward a rich discourse between music composition, performance, and appreciation, on one end, and the cognitive plasticity of our spirituality in the cultural contexts of musical creativity, on the other.  Examples of relevant morphologies and compositional processes used to suggest a path from soul to self are discussed. Engaging in an inter-cultural and inter-spiritual dialogue, the paper suggest a dialectic between sound and religious experience in music, a connection that that gives the notion of the human spirit central form of expression in the performing arts.

        "excerpt":"I am a recipient of 2013 Duquesne University Presidential Scholarship Award for a preparation of my manuscript for publication as an article, The Apperception of Musical Creativity: Performance as Ritual, Composition as Prayer. The original paper was presented under at The Chant and Improvisation in the Liturgy Symposium during the Aesthetics and Pedagogy of Charles Tournemire music conference, which was organized by the Mary Pappert School of Music at Duquesne University in October 2012. The manuscript is currently submitted for publication review. The article’s intellectual and musicological significance to humanities scholars, performers, composers and general audiences is of great importance as it not only offers a comprehensive overview of musical creativity, but it further highlights the notion of spirituality in musical arts. I wish to thank the music faculty at the Mary Pappert School of Music for their encouragement and support. Paper Abstract      The Apperception of Musical Creativity: Performance as Ritual, Composition as Prayer   A musical performance can be described in terms of symbolic and stylized acts or actions and musical creation that is understood as the mind’s enactment of contemplation or prayer.  The article defines musical invention as a creative spiritual process. It draws on the relationship between the two attributes of musical creation: the cognitive and performative ones controlled and sustained by the cognitive nervous system, and the emotional and spiritual attributes that may be understood as musical self-realization or prayer. The discussion unfolds around the physicality and psychology of musical creativity, as well as its spiritual ramifications in performance and composition. Along with present-day research in psychology and religious studies, the project brings forth a direct link between musical creativity and spirituality. It develops the theory of the apperception of musical creativity in the performing arts using the notions of ritual and prayer as mutually inclusive idiosyncrasies of spiritual and musical experiences.  The complex nature of musical creativity suggests further emotional and musical representations of specific, freely associated experiences accrued and construed by the composer or performer. When this occurs, the music’s distinct character is apperceived as a musical ritual in terms of an induced spiritual ethos, rather than a mere execution of idiomatically constructed musical sequences.

The performance took place at PNC Recital Hall at Duquesne University. Angel Antiphons was composed in honor of Benjamin Britten’s birth centenary (1913-2013).The work can best be described as a joyous celebration of life and music. The musical material, which consists of two contrasting ideas, propels the spiral-like form whose formal and structural framework reveals ceremonial and ritual-like sections on one end, and more fluid and exuberant ones, on the other. The slower sections in the piece elaborate on a short melodic fragment taken from Britten’s anthem for mixed choir and organ, Antiphon, composed in 1956. ","categories": ["composition"],

        "title": "Embodied Cognition of Musical Creativity",
        "excerpt":"My study on cognitive aspects of composition and performance Ligeti’s Piano Etude no 15, White on White, will be presented in a lecture-recital at the International Festival for Artistic Innovation at Leeds College of Music (UK) in March 2014. The festival emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary and collaborative practices in music and the arts. It will feature concerts, presentations, interactive workshops and masterclasses that involve music production, jazz, contemporary classical music and popular music (composition, performance, production and pedagogy in both their ‘distinct’ forms and as part of interdisciplinary arts practice). The goal of IFAI is to highlight themes of innovation, creativity, and collaboration as the related to the festival’s mission and outreach statement. The participants will share their contributions in the fields of music composition, performance, and interdisciplinary practices, analysis, critical theory, musicology, and pedagogy. This research on Ligeti’s compositional practice in the context of embodied cognition was also featured at Ligeti Symposium and Festivalat Florida State University (October 10-13, 2013). Celebrating the musical legacy of György Ligeti, the conference gathered scholars, performers, and composers inspired by Ligeti’s music and writings. Daytime lectures featured presenters from the United States and Europe. The evening concerts included the complete performances of Ligeti’s complete Piano Etudes, Musica Ricercata, Piano Concerto, and Horn Trio, among others. For more information and a list of events, visit the Florida State University Ligeti Conference Schedule. Paper Abstract      While there are numerous theoretical aspects to his compositional process, Ligeti’s compositional output ultimately reveals his pragmatic nature, closely related to the composer’s unique attitude toward the composition and performance of his works. This paper places Ligeti’s compositional practices in the context of embodied cognition. It achieves this by discussing Ligeti’s work as a representation of a high level of mental and physical constructs, taking direction from those scholars who have focused on the ways in which theories from psychology, linguistics, cognitive science, dynamical systems, and neuroscience coalesce to define the concept embodied mind. By considering the significance of these aspects in conjunction with other musical parameters, the paper offers an analytical overview of Ligeti’s compositional process in his Piano Etude no. 15, also known as White on White.     The paper suggests that the musical and philosophical message of Ligeti’s compositional process derives from the mental and physical forms of the human body; forms which largely determine and condition the nature of his compositions. In particular, the relationship between cognitive and physical aspects of embodied cognition serves as an analytical tool in surveying Ligeti’s creative practice. Discussing the composer’s evident relationship to performative physicality and cognitive plasticity in his study for piano solo, the paper argues that Ligeti’s compositional process draws on aspects of the body (performance and physical perception) in shaping those of cognition (composition and mental representation). In unfolding his compositional process the composer offers a creative paradigm by which the musical composition may offer insight into an embodied mind. ","categories": ["research"],

The Marriott Hotel, Copley Place at 110 Huntington Avenue, Boston, MA. Paper Abstract      Extemporaneous Sublime: Indeterminacy and Transience of the Improvised Moment    The connection between musical improvisation and the experience of the musically sublime represents an oft-concealed thread between the very acts of spontaneous music making and the acts of listening. In my presentation I explore analogies between the embodied sense of indeterminacy and transience in improvised music and the aesthetics of the musically sublime. I examine the notion of the musically sublime as an attribute of the embodiment of musical creativity that can be evoked through the performative act of musical improvisation. I define musical improvisation as a process of creative awareness: a quest to understand how the mind and body contribute to the awareness of musical creativity. I draw on my experience as a keyboard improviser and empirical studies to describe how musicians, both consciously and unconsciously, seek to translate their musical creativity through improvisation. While the discussion unfolds around the notion of the musically sublime, in my presentation I also argue that compositional and aesthetic constraints become important catalysts in the production-realization process of the musical imagination. By evoking the sublime aspects of creative musical embodiment, I put forward a perspective that serves as a philosophical counterpoint to the performative and cognitive attributes of musical creativity.

Excerpt from the Album’s Liner Notes The pieces on this album of solo piano music are arranged in an infinite loop of interwoven historical threads. Earlier pieces mingle provocatively with later ones, and the final and most recent work on the album, of the lake III (2014), ends with an inversion of the sparse opening notes of the first work, of the lake I (2007, rev. 2014). The last piece could lead seamlessly into the first, making it possible for us to circumnavigate the loop again. Listeners may enjoy playing the album on repeat in order to take full advantage of this arrangement, but to understand the evolution of Nagy’s music over the 16-year period covered here (1998-2014), it may be best to consider the works in the order in which they were composed. From that perspective, we may observe Nagy’s progression away from traditional musical rhetoric and toward a kind of music that encourages a contemplative resting in time that is, away from becoming and toward being. The common element in all of this is an intense, abiding, almost ethical obsession with harmonic color. ","categories": ["composition"],

In this graduate and advanced undergraduate seminar, I plan to survey the multi-disciplinary perspectives on musical creativity in composition, performance, listening, and pedagogy of music.   Course Description This course surveys the multi-disciplinary perspectives on musical creativity in composition, performance, appreciation, and teaching of music. Musical creativity is considered to be a personal, internal activity that results in new musical representations (i.e., inner hearing and imagery) and manifestations (i.e., completed composition and performance). The course explores the research and findings that studies in music psychology, cognitive science,  music theory, musicology, education, and performance have produced, together with their implications on the multimodality of creative experience in music. This perspective allows for a larger contextual relationship for the critical analysis of musical creativity. Exploring the correlation of the physical and mental activities of music, this course redefines the notion of musical creativity by proposing a pragmatic relationship between creation, reproduction, and perception of music. The course also investigates creativity in music education as it reviews the pedagogical frameworks employed in the creative musical arts. The course will result in research projects followed by student forum presentations. ","categories": ["teaching"],

        "excerpt":"My research on embodiment of musical creativity was featured at the International Conference on the Multimodal Experience of Music at the University of Sheffield in March 2015. I had a privilege to present a scholarly paper entitled The Multimodality of Creative Experience: Towards the Embodiment of Musical Creativity. The abridged abstract is included below. International Conference on the Multimodal Experience of Music aims to bring together researchers from various disciplines who investigate the multimodality of musical experiences from different perspectives. Disciplines may include audiology, cognition, computer science, music performance and theory, neuroscience, philosophy, and psychology. Presentation formats include papers, symposia, demonstrations and posters. Paper Abstract      From the perspective of a composer, the paper conceives of creativity as a multidisciplinary investigation into the structure of musical experience: a creative endeavor defined by a fusion of cognitive and perceptual mechanisms. It is from this perspective that the paper explores the creative modalities and multimodal associations through which composers engage with creativity. In particular, the paper defines creative experience as interplay of both mental and physical processes that contribute to the formation of cognitive and performative modalities of creative experience (such as auditory imagery and inner hearing, and completed or realized musical compositions and performances, respectively.) The main objective of this investigation is the developmental exploration of multi-modal dichotomies that underlie the embodied nature of creative awareness whose psychological and physiological associations become the foundation for the understanding of the embodiment of musical creativity. As a case study, the paper considers the most direct source for this inquiry to be the compositional process itself. Thus, the paper develops a theoretical framework to investigate the causality of the cognitive and performative referents of those modalities responsible for the formation of the embodiment of musical creativity.

Written as a way of acknowledging the installation of the new organ on Duquesne campus and honoring the memory of the university founders from Germany, the piece will be premiered by Dr. Edward Kocher, the William Patrick Power Endowed Faculty Chair in Academic Leadership and Dr. Ann Labounsky, Professor and Chair of Organ and Sacred Music. Leib und Körper is constructed in two movements that in turn express two aspects of the body, the first meditative, inward, subjective and the second physical, exuberant, objective. The title of the work comes from the writings of the German phenomenologist philosopher, Hermann Schmitz (b. 1928). The first movement, entitled “Lieb” denotes a personal body or corporeality, suggesting cognitive, inner and immediate affective states; the second movement, entitled “Körper” refers to the idea of a physical body, suggesting more conative, perceptual, and visceral experiences.

Yet, improvisers often talk about the retrospective nature of improvisation, suggesting conceptual links with those of composition. Drawing upon theoretical and empirical studies from the psychology of improvisation, this paper challenges arguments that improvisation lacks the elements of a completed musical work, often implying that the act of composition is a static, offline activity. This paper thus attempts to reconcile these contrasting viewpoints by suggesting new analytical practices that draw a line connecting, rather than separating, composition and improvisation, while portraying improvised performance as an extemporaneous composition that possess visceral, embodied qualities. The author examines the impact of compositional process on the practice of musical improvisation through a multi-layered analysis of the act of improvisation using the conceptual tools of cognition through the contextual acts of perception. The author defines improvisation as real-time composition by examining cognitive representations and performative manifestations of musical creativity as important links between composition and improvisation. The author then further discusses improvisational creativity as an act by which various psychological mechanisms and aesthetic qualities may influence compositional structures and thus condition the real-time constraints that improvisers face when performing improvised music. The issues studied include concepts from creativity, composition, and performance studies, embodied music cognition, and musical aesthetics. The paper offers a qualitative analysis of compositional elements and techniques found in improvised music, thereby suggesting possible tools for their analysis. ","categories": ["research"],

        "title": "Embodied Monologues",
        "excerpt":"In March 2017, I visited Maynooth University in Ireland, where I presented a paper at Embodied Monologues research series and symposium. The symposium “seeks to generate responses and challenges to the idea of solo or ‘mono’ performance,” while asking important questions on “the role of the intertextual, the multimedial, the intercorporeal in this mode of performance.” Abstract Contemporary study and practice of composition often equates the act of composing music with reflexive creative processes, implying a mind-body duality between the conceptualization and contextualization of compositional creativity. The paper challenges this notion by defining creativity in musical composition as a multidisciplinary investigation into the structure of musical experience: a creative endeavor defined by a fusion of cognitive and perceptual mechanisms. In order to further explore how composers engage with creativity, the paper investigates the psychological attributes of creative cognition whose associations become the foundation for an understanding of embodied creativity in musical composition. Here the embodiment of musical creativity is defined as a cognitive and performative causality: a relationship between the cause and effect of our creative experience when composing music. On this ground, the paper surveys the psychological foundations of creativity as it redefines musical composition using the framework of embodiment as its main unifying concept. Using examples from empirical and theoretical research in creativity studies, music psychology, embodied music cognition, philosophy, and the author’s own creative practice, the paper makes an argument for the reciprocity of creative cognition and conation in the act of musical composition. Given the cognitive approach to musical creativity, and employing a practice-based research methodology, the paper thus develops an integrative theoretical model to account for the causality of the cognitive and performative psychological referents responsible for the formation of the embodied creativity in music.

The symposium featured daily concerts, panels, and presentations on contemporary music. Characterized by a fantasy-like, rhapsodic narrative, Ricercar dell’affinità employs several compositional techniques derived from the composer’s exploration of the perceptual affinity of tones. The processual musical objects are distinguished by unique timbres and textures, in turn suggesting a musical and procedural affinity produced by gradual transformations of the tonal and metric structure. Following a short, improvisatory prologue, the piece unfolds in two contrasting sections, with the first one featuring a two-part, cyclical counterpoint of rapid florid gestures, and the second displaying more melodically and harmonically linear material.

        "excerpt":"As a recipient of the Duquesne University’s Paluse Faculty Research Grant, I will compose a new multi-media musical composition based on the writing and drawings from Thomas Merton’s book, Dialogues of Silence. A writer, theologian, and mystic, Thomas Merton (1915 – 1968) remained an avid social critic and advocate of fundamental human and spiritual rights and values. In an effort to explore the role of the sacred in the search for common good, in composing my new musical composition I will consider Merton’s concept of silence as a contemplative agent for social change in our world. Scored for baritone voice, flute, and a collection of percussion instruments, the new 50-minute work will set a selection of Merton’s texts and drawings to music. It will be accompanied by electronically manipulated sounds that will act as a sonic backdrop to the selected drawings. The Paluse Faculty Research Grant is an important university-wide internal funding opportunity intended to support scholarly research that reflects the mission and identity of Duquesne University. The grants are open to full-time faculty working in any academic discipline. Grant awards are for $6,000, and up to two grants are awarded per academic year. The award will support the Pittsburgh performance and recording of the new work during the 2018-19 academic year. Special thanks to the Thomas Merton Center at Bellarmine University for granting the permissions to use the Merton’s writing and drawings in my new composition. ","categories": ["composition"],

Including representatives of IRCAM, the Société des arts technologiques, the Université de Montréal, the workshop will take place on April 2-5, 2020 at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. With the topic of Spatialization, Orchestration, Perception, the workshop is designed to investigate different aspects of musical space and timbre. I am scheduled to deliver an introduction to the creative music encoding of compositions; a brief description of my contribution is included below. Code as Music: An Introduction to the Music Encoding of Compositions The computer-assisted composition is considered both a tool in the creation and optimization of the compositional process and as a means for the generation of music notation created by a computer. The author presents an integrated approach to music computing and notation that offers a means of encoding methodology that fuses the conceptualization of music encoding with the contextualization of encoded music. This results in an approach to computer-assisted composition that aims to combine the symbolic music information generation and retrieval process with a digital representation of the musical structure. The former is achieved by the conceptual encoding of given data structures using Abjad, a Python application programming interface that enables composers to encode musical representations and levels of musical structure incrementally (e.g., through the assemblage of basic building blocks of musical objects: pitches, chords, rhythms, meters, as well as dynamics, articulations, etc.). The latter is realized in the form of a typeset score using Lilypond, a computer program for music engraving written in C++ that is integrated with the Abjad package, which in turn enables composers to have direct control over the notation and engraving of the notational objects. This process allows for not only a more interactive encapsulation of the creative process within the environment for algorithmic composition, but it also accounts for the formation of compositional inheritances of object-oriented programming. The creative potential from this approach to computer-assisted composition provides opportunities for contextual application of music encoding of musical structure as a type of formalized score control.

I will give a keynote talk on compositional creativity, the topic I explored in my book, The Embodiment of Musical Creativity: The Cognitive and Performative Causality of Musical Composition (Routledge).   The Embodied Creativity of Musical Composition Contemporary musical composition practice equates composing music with intuitive, creative processes, implying a mind-body duality between the conceptualization and contextualization of musical creativity. In my talk, I challenge this notion by defining creativity in musical composition as a multidisciplinary investigation into the structure of musical experience: a creative endeavor defined by a fusion of cognition and perception. To further explore how composers engage with creativity, I investigate the psychological attributes of creative cognition whose associations become the foundation for understanding embodied creativity in musical composition. I define the embodiment of musical creativity as a cognitive and performative causality: a relationship between the cause and effect of our creative experience when composing music. I survey the psychological foundations of creativity as they redefine musical composition using the framework of embodiment as its central unifying concept. Using examples from empirical and theoretical research in creativity studies, music psychology, embodied music cognition, philosophy, and my creative practice, I argue for the reciprocity of creative cognition and perception in the act of musical composition. Finally, I develop an integrative theoretical model to account for the causality of the cognitive and performative psychological referents responsible for the emergence of embodied creativity in musical arts.

        "title": "Poiesis and the Typologies of Musical Creativity",
        "excerpt":"I am pleased to have been invited to give a talk at the Creativity Conference at Southern Oregon University in a beautiful city of Ashland, Oregon. Creativity Conference brought together scholars and practitioners who study the science of creativity, seek to leverage research on creative thinking, or simply consider themselves to be creative! The conference took place May 18-32, 2023. Creativity results from our actions and interactions with the world around us. I think of creativity as poiesis, which means to create or bring something into being. This involves different creative processes, forms of knowledge, and perspectives. I suggest that three types of poiesis show how the creative agency works: autopoiesis, where a system can recreate itself; allopoiesis, where a system can create something different from itself; and practopoiesis, where creative agency adjusts itself by working through a series of interactions among its creative processes. This results in a type of creativity independent of other creative processes and their own creative spaces, providing a different perspective on our understanding of musical creativity. I thank Weatherford College and Southwesern Adventist University for supporting this research. I look forward to giving a lecture on this topic at Saybrook University in August 2023. Abstract As a multimodal interplay of creative actions and interactions, creativity is viewed as a composite of culturally and socially conditioned processes and products. In recent studies on embodied music cognition, it has been suggested that creativity is a product of our bodies’ actions and interactions with the environment. The author places creativity in the context of poiesis: to make or to bring something into being. Poiesis implies a synergy of creative processes, forms of knowledge, and perspectives. Defining poiesis as creative agency, the author focuses on a complementary aspect of poiesis, one of emergence. Expanding upon the notion of embodied creative spaces, the author proposes the formation of typologies of emerging creative processes. In turn, the author describes three types of poiesis as instances of self-referential creative agency: autopoiesis, the process by which a system can recreate itself; allopoiesis, the process by which a system can create something other than itself; and practopoiesis, the process by which creative agency’s autopoiesis works through a series of interactions among its creative processes to adjust itself. This, in turn, results in a type of creativity characterized by self-referential processes that are independent of other creative processes and their own creative spaces. Informed by the creative potentiality of artistic agency and to provide a complementary perspective on our understanding of musical creativity, the author presents three short case studies that illustrate the different types of topologies of creativity that emerge within the acts of musical composition.

        "excerpt":"I will give a guest lecture seminar at Saybrook University’s Humanistic Psychology department during Saybrook’s Fall 2023 Virtual Learning Experience. Located in Pasadena, California, Saybrook’s Virtual Learning Experiences bring students, faculty, and amazing speakers together to participate in an exceptional learning environment tailored to providing a safe and supportive space for student’s inquisitiveness and eagerness to learn. Saybrook’s humanistic and clinical psychology programs are designed for those who wish to contribute creatively to improving the human condition. Students are encouraged to explore different approaches through interdisciplinary programs that combine complementary approaches–including meditation, nutrition, energy medicine, biofeedback, and spirituality—with more traditional forms of care. Creativity results from our actions and interactions with the world around us. I think of creativity as poiesis, which means to create or bring something into being. This involves different creative processes, forms of knowledge, and perspectives. I suggest that three types of poiesis show how the creative agency works: autopoiesis, where a system can recreate itself; allopoiesis, where a system can create something different from itself; and practopoiesis, where creative agency adjusts itself by working through a series of interactions among its creative processes. This results in a type of creativity independent of other creative processes and their own creative spaces, providing a different perspective on our understanding of musical creativity. In the lecture, I discuss how cultivating one’s creative skills reveal meaningful differences and cultivate a sense of responsibility to bring them out at their best in the context of poiesis and the typologies of musical creativity. I further explore “creative spaces” and where we can find inspiration to understand creativity and in turn be more creative. I used several different sources like biology, philosophy, and humanistic psychology (specifically music and creativity studies) to make my point. My goal is to show how we can connect the science of life and mind with our own experiences and feelings when it comes to making music. Lecture Abstract As a multimodal interplay of creative actions and interactions, creativity is viewed as a composite of culturally and socially conditioned processes and products. In recent studies on embodied music cognition, it has been suggested that creativity is a product of our bodies’ actions and interactions with the environment. The author places creativity in the context of poiesis: to make or to bring something into being. Poiesis implies a synergy of creative processes, forms of knowledge, and perspectives. Defining poiesis as creative agency, the author focuses on a complementary aspect of poiesis, one of emergence. Expanding upon the notion of embodied creative spaces, the author proposes the formation of typologies of emerging creative processes. In turn, the author describes three types of poiesis as instances of self-referential creative agency: autopoiesis, the process by which a system can recreate itself; allopoiesis, the process by which a system can create something other than itself; and practopoiesis, the process by which creative agency’s autopoiesis works through a series of interactions among its creative processes to adjust itself. This, in turn, results in a type of creativity characterized by self-referential processes that are independent of other creative processes and their own creative spaces. Informed by the creative potentiality of artistic agency and to provide a complementary perspective on our understanding of musical creativity, the author presents three short case studies that illustrate the different types of topologies of creativity that emerge within the acts of musical composition.

        "excerpt":"Book Routledge An Ashgate Book: SEMPRE Series in the Psychology of Music (2017) Embodiment of Musical Creativity   Book Summary  Embodiment of Musical Creativity offers an innovative look at the interdisciplinary nature of creativity in musical composition. Using examples from empirical and theoretical research in creativity studies, music theory and cognition, psychology and philosophy, performance and education studies, and the author’s own creative practice, the book examines how the reciprocity of cognition and performativity contributes to our understanding of musical creativity in composition. From the composer’s perspective the book investigates the psychological attributes of creative cognition whose associations become the foundation for an understanding of embodied creativity in musical composition. The book defines the embodiment of musical creativity as a cognitive and performative causality: a relationship between the cause and effect of our experience when composing music. Considering the theoretical, practical, contextual, and pedagogical implications of embodied creative experience, the book redefines aspects of musical composition to reflect the changing ways that musical creativity is understood and evaluated. Embodiment of Musical Creativity provides a comparative study of musical composition, in turn articulating a new perspective on musical creativity.   Reviews       This pioneering work on musical creativity breaks new ground on definitions and applications of the term and is presented in both readable and a logical fashion. Nagy is adept at drawing together many disciplines and presenting a rich and complex contribution to our understanding of the interdisciplinary nature of creativity. This highly recommended text is a valuable resources and provocative inspiration not only for composers, but also for performers and listeners too. - Andrew Shenton, Boston University         The book contents offer an innovative focus on composition that draws on an evidence-based and reflective understanding of both cognition and performativity. As the same time, the text provides deeper insights into the multimodal nature of creativity itself. Nagy’s choice of topics and focus on embodiment is in line with a new wave of music studies that seek to understand how our bodymind design is reciprocally interwoven in the ways that we make sense of, and generate, musical experience. Nagy’s personal reflections on his experiences as a composer and academic provide a strong basis for this rich narrative that concludes with an elaboration of the pedagogical implications for the teaching of compositional creativity. - Graham Welch, Series Editor, University College London   Articles Journal of Genius and Eminence (2019) Music and Embodied Creative Space   Abstract  Informed by theoretical and empirical research in the cognitive sciences this article seeks to identify a relationship between musical creativity and embodiment. While focusing on the central hypothesis that exposure to specific musical practices leads to the formation of multimodal creative agency, an argument is made for the emergence of an embodied creative space. The embodiment of musical creativity is defined as a cognitive and performative causality: a relationship between the cause and effect when composing, performing, or listening to music. Expanding on this model, music-making is further considered to be an embodied activity that stems from the causality of these interdependent attributes of creativity: the cognitive actions controlled and sustained by our mind, and the performative interactions mediated by our body and the environment. By exploring the actions and interactions commonly associated with composing and performing music, the author defines the embodied creative musical space as an interactive agency that lives at the threshold of cognition and performativity. In order to support this argument, the author relates images and places from the art of memory to the act of making music, while placing the compositional work of Johann Sebastian Bach in the context of present-day practice of creating music. As a result, the nature of musical creativity as an embodied, lived experience extends the social and collaborative concepts of creativity, as it becomes an interactive creative contingency. Delivered from the perspective of a composer, performer, and music scholar, this article contributes to the growing interdisciplinary discourse on musical creativity. Creativity Research Journal (2015) The Apperception of Musical Creativity   Abstract  Musical invention is defined in this article as a form of inward creativity. The creative acts of musical performance are understood in terms of ritual-like symbolic and stylized actions, and those of musical composition as the mind's enactment of meditation and reflection. This article draws on the relationship between two psychological attributes of musical creativity: the cognitive ones controlled and sustained by the central nervous system, and the emotional attributes that may be understood as a sense of inward reflection. The complex nature of musical creativity suggests further emotional and musical representations accumulated and constructed by the composer or performer. When this occurs, music's distinct character is apperceived as a musical ritual in terms of self-realization, rather than a mere execution of idiomatically constructed musical sequences. Along with present-day research in psychology and perspectives on cognitive neuroscience of creativity, this article brings forth a direct link between musical creativity, ritual, and self-awareness. It develops a theory of the apperception of musical creativity in performance and composition using the notions of ritual and self-realization as mutually inclusive idiosyncrasies of musical experience.

The primary focus of my book will be to explore how the embodiment of creativity allows for the formation of new creative contexts when making music by means of actions and interactions of the psychological and physical properties of creative processes. Informed by empirical and theoretical creativity studies, in my project I will employ qualitative psychological research along with interactive computer creativity systems and computational models of creativity. I believe my book would contribute to the interdisciplinary discourse on musical creativity. Theoretical Modeling Derivation of Pitch Constructs from the Spectral Profiles of Tones      Informed by the empirical and theoretical work in cognitive neuroscience of music and embodied music cognition, the paper proposes a theoretical model for the formation of spectral pitch space. By examining the spectral profiles of tones, the paper accounts for a generative structural principle in identifying pitch templates for the organization of harmonic structure in spectral music. The model is implemented in OpenMusic, a visual programming environment for construction and transformation of functions and data structures. ","categories": [],
