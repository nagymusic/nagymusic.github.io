Zvony (Zvonimir) Nagy (pronounced /zvônimiːr nadj;/) is a Croatian-born, American performer, scholar, composer, and educator. His work extends into interdisciplinary contexts and perspectives on musical creativity in performance and composition with published scholarly and compositional research.

As an organist and pianist, Nagy has performed as a soloist, chamber musician, and conductor throughout the United States and Europe. He received the second prize in the César Franck/Olivier Messiaen International Organ Competition in Haarlem, the Netherlands. He draws from experimental and historical improvisation practices, interactive media technologies, and interdisciplinary collaborations. His piano and organ recordings are available at PARMA Recordings-Ravello Records, Albany Records, and MSR Classics. As a church musician, Nagy has served as director of sacred music at churches and cathedrals throughout the United States. He has experience with choral and instrumental conducting, training and formation of cantors and choristers, and composing and arranging music for worship; he is currently an Organist and Choirmaster at the Church of the Holy Apostles in Fort Worth, Texas. He has an ongoing commitment to sacred music and intimate knowledge of liturgy and different types of music programs.  

As a scholar, Nagy's research focuses on systematic musicology, creativity studies, and contemporary music and spirituality. He applies insights from embodied music cognition to the study, practice, and teaching of music. His monograph, entitled _Embodiment of Musical Creativity: The Cognitive and Performative Causality of Musical Composition_ (Routledge, 2017, An Ashgate Book in the SEMPRE Series on Psychology of Music), offers an innovative look at the interdisciplinary nature of musical creativity. In the book, he investigated the psychological attributes of creative cognition whose associations become the foundation for understanding embodied creativity in music. In addition to exploring psychological mechanisms and functions linked to musical creativity, in the book, he also developed methodologies from humanistic and scientific disciplines to understand creativity as a fundamental property of human cognition, behavior, and culture. Expanding on the model of musical creativity that he developed in his first book, he is currently working on a new book project that explores the creativity in contemporary sacred music. He investigates the spiritual and theological implications that meditated -- composed, performed, improvised -- sound has on the formation of 'creative musical spaces,' on the embodied attributes and elements that inhabit these spaces, and the experience of performers and listeners extending those spaces.

Nagy views the process of composition as an investigation into the structure of musical creativity. His compositions are informed by cognitive and computer sciences of music and are shaped by technology, spirituality, and social issues. His composition approach is an interdisciplinary one that centers on compositional morphologies that explore the creative dialogue between cognition and perception, conceptualization and contextualization, and tradition and innovation. He is influenced by experimental, postminimalist, and sound art music, and combines computer-assisted music creation and algorithmic systems with more intuitive approaches to compositional techniques and procedures. Recent composition projects included a new multimedia work for flute, baritone, and percussion, _Dialogues with Silence_; _Anima Animæ_, a newly commissioned string quartet for the Beo String Quartet; and a new commission project from The Brass Project Ensemble.

As a composer with a diverse range of interests, Nagy has had great success having his work premiered in Europe and North and South America. Performances of his works range from multimedia art pieces, choral groups, and solo performers to new music ensembles and professional symphony orchestras, and include works for concert, church, and installation performances. He is the recipient of composition awards and grants such as the first prize in the Cremona Musica Yamaha Disklavier Composition Competition (2019), The Pittsburgh Foundation and The Heinz Endowments Investing in Professional Artists Grant (2017-18), the Paluse Research Grant (2018-19), the Presidential Scholarship Award from Duquesne University (2013), the Seattle Symphony Composition Prize (2012), the Iron Composer Award (2011), the Swan Prize in Music Composition from the University of Minnesota (2011), the Karlins Award at Northwestern University (2008), and the Croatian Music Institute Award (2002). He has also written for and received commissions from performers and ensembles, such as the Seattle Symphony, musicians from the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, the Mivos String Quartet, the Beo String Quartet, Chatter Ensemble, the Boston Choral Ensemble, Alia Musica Ensemble, Reed III Ensemble, Trio Jónio, Cleveland Contemporary Chamber Players, and JACK Quartet, among others. Recordings of his compositions are available from PARMA Recordings (_Angelus: Works for Organ_, 2018), Albany Records (_Liquescence: Music for Ensembles_, 2017), and MSR Classics (_Vestiges: Music for Piano_, 2014). His music is published by <a href="https://www.universaledition.com/zvony-nagy-7865">Universal Edition</a> (Vienna), <a href="https://paracletesheetmusic.com/composer/zvonimir-nagy/">Paraclete Press</a> (Boston), World Library Publications (Chicago, IL), MusikFabrik (France), and Aldebaran Editions (Italy). Classical Music Review has called his music "hauntingly beautiful," and American Record Guide described his compositions as possessing "glacially slow, light ambiance to a simultaneously wild and dense eruption of sound."
<!--Nagy's research field is musical composition, creativity, and technology, and his areas of specialization are embodied music cognition, modern music and computer-assisted creativity.-->

Dr. Nagy has a proven record of internationally recognized scholarly and creative work and can provide a high standard of teaching. He has taught music at Tarleton State University (Texas A&M), Duquesne University, Northwestern University, and St. Xavier University in Chicago.
