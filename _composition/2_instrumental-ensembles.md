  <h4>Program Note</h4>
  <p>Being my most personal piece to date, <i>Anima Animae</i>  depicts by musical means growth cycles of the human life, in part suggesting more spiritual ramifications of "anima animae" or the birth of "a soul of the soul." The piece unfolds in two parts, with the second redefining the first's musical structure and form.</p>

 <p>Part I <i>Very fast, from "known" time</i></p>

 <p>Part II <i>Becoming fast, towards "unknown" time, like a lullaby</i></p>

 <p><i>Anima Animae</i> was commissioned by the 2018 Charlotte New Music Festival for the Beo String Quartet.</p>

## The Idol and the Ikon
Oboe and vibraphone (2018) 8'

  <h4>Program Note</h4>
  <p><i>The Idol and the Ikon</i> takes its title from a chapter of the same name found in the book, <i>God Without Being</i> by the French philosopher and theologian, Jean-Luc Marion. The piece gradually unfolds in two sections, creating mirror images of recursive perspectives that coalesce into a steady intent of listening experience. As Marion puts it, "What characterizes the material idol is precisely that the artist can consign to it the subjugating brilliance of a first visible; on the contrary, what characterizes the icon painted on wood does not come from the hand of a man but from the infinite depth that crosses it—or better, orients it following the intention of a gaze." (<i>God Without Being</i>, p. 21)</p>

## Carmen Perpetuum
String ensemble (6-2-2-1) (2017) 10'

<div data-configid="9835853/59113230" style="width:100%; height:243px;" class="issuuembed"></div>
<script type="text/javascript" src="//e.issuu.com/embed.js" async="true"></script>

<div class="notice">
  <h4>Program Note</h4>
  <p>Taking its title from the beginning of Ovid's <i>Metamorphoses</i>," <i>Carmen Perpetuum</i> (2015) or "unbroken song," unfolds into two contrasting sections: the first section introduces somewhat meditative character in moderate tempo, gradually increasing in intensity, followed by a fast and unceasing motto perpetuo section. In the beginning, a melodic-harmonic line serves as the underpinning for the entire piece, accumulating the musical energy throughout the first section of the piece, to eventually produce something new and extremely energetic at the end. The musical material employed in the piece was originally featured in the first movement from <i>Two Canons</i> for organ (2007, rev. 2017). What unites the piece musically is a constantly recurring melody, spiral-like canons embracing the cantus firmus that, to quote Gabrielle Starr in her book <i>Feeling Beauty</i> (2013), becomes "a song never ending in its transformation and evolution" (146).</p>

## Fall, Leaves, Fall
String quartet (2016) 8'

<div class="notice">
  <h4>Program Note</h4>
  <p>A cavatina for string quartet, <i>Fall, Leaves, Fall</i> resonates an inward sentiment suggested by hushed but expressive thematic writing and discrete harmonic language. Evocative in nature, the piece unfolds a series of episodes that build energy and forward movement, while at the same time preserving the intimate mood of melodic gestalt on its elegiac course. The fragile and delicate sense of continuity is contrasted by fragmentary trepidation, framing timeless moments of serene expectation. <i>Fall, Leaves, Fall</i>, was inspired by a poem by Emily Brontë that encapsulates the emotional struggle for a sense of belonging and the nostalgic acceptance of new cultures, places, realities ...</p>

Alto flute, English horn, and bass clarinet (2015, rev. 2016) 13'

<div class="notice">
  <h4>Program Note</h4>
  <p>Conceived as a series of sonic images, <i>Liquescence</i> is based entirely on a simple harmonic phrase using only five pitches and a fixed durational matrix. Throughout the piece, each phrase is systematically rotated, while additional, contrapuntal lines are gradually superimposed onto the fixed harmonic space. While the static nature of the music becomes apparent, the music unfolds a range of textures and subsidiary melodic figures that are produced by an extensive exploration of the timbral possibilities of the given instrumental ensemble.</p>

<!-- ## Leib und Körper
Two movements for trombone and organ (2015) 11'

<div class="notice">
  <h4>Program Note</h4>
  <p><i>Leib und Körper</i> express two aspects of the body, the first meditative and inward and the second physical and exuberant. The title of the work comes from the writings of the German philosopher, Hermann Schmitz (b. 1928), the founder of what is known as the New Phenomenology. The first movement, entitled <i>Lieb</i> denotes a personal body or corporeality, suggesting cognitive, inner and immediate affective states; the second movement, entitled <i>Körper</i> refers to the idea of a physical body, suggesting more conative, perrceptual and visceral experiences.</p>

<!-- ## Tonus Contra Tonum
For four pitched instruments (2015) 10'

<div class="notice">
  <h4>Program Note</h4>
  <p>The title for this work comes as an honor to the work of the composer Paul Hindemith (1895-1963). Hindemith's theoretical concepts, especially those pertaining to musical composition and analysis, remain an inspiration in my own work as a composer. Similar to the 14th-century idea of <i>punctus contra punctum</i>, Lat. 'point against point', or in more musical terms – note against note, <i>Tonus Contra Tonum</i> refers to the complex way in which musical tones and harmonies relate to each other. In a way similar to Hindemith’s theoretical concepts, in my composition I employed an idiosyncratic harmonic language based on the perceptual affinity of tones and their tonal and metric relationships.</p>

<div class="notice">
  <h4>Program Note</h4>
  <p>Scored as a triptych, <i>Kaleidoscope</i> depicts self-sustaining musical transformations that coalesce into fluid, constantly evolving, mirage-like structures. Recursive patterns of harmonies and emerging melodies, along with the interactive contrapuntal symmetries between the instruments, suggest the refractory patterns of light formed by mirrors containing pieces of colored glass, such as those found in a kaleidoscope. This can be heard where patterns of musical shapes emerge that invite the listener to enter an Escher-like musical space.</p>

  <p><i>Kaleidoscope</i> was commissioned by Elisa Elisa Järvi and Andrea Kiefer.</p>

## Epigram Variations

<div class="notice">
  <h4>Program Note</h4>
  <p>Largely based on Bach’s <i>Prelude</i> from Cello Suite no. 1 in G major, BWV 1007, and composed in part as an opposition to it, <i>Epigram Variations</i> offers a collage-like re-composition of the basic musical material extrapolated from Bach’s composition. By carefully examining consecutive musical motives and phrases from the original source, the so-called “theme” of the piece becomes gradually revealed in each consecutive variation. Through the systematic transformation of musical material, the composition de-constructs the musical past by offering retrospective instances of the newly composed narrative. As a result, the piece smoothly segues into an extemporaneous fantasy, culminating in visceral, ostinato-driven melodic and rhythmic lines.</p>

## Angel Annunciation
Cello and Piano (2012) 15'

<div class="notice">
  <h4>Program Note</h4>
  <p>Characterized by its large formal design, <i>Angel Annunciation</i> was inspired by a passage from an essay on Barnett Newman’s paintings from Jean-François Lyotard’s (1924-1998) essay, <i>Newman: The Instant:</i> “... it is an angel. It announces nothing; it is in itself an annunciation.” Resembling the unfolding of a spiral, the piece alternates between two contrasting ideas: a contemplative chorale delineated by a lament-like melody, followed by more flowing, rapidly alternating canons that echo the original musical material, creating a sense of mystery. The cello and piano parts complement each other by reinforcing the synergy found in the reciprocity of those two musical ideas. The work was dedicated in memoriam to the composer’s first composition teacher, the Croatian composer Marko Ruždjak (1946-2012).</p>

## intimate stream[s]
String quartet (2008, rev. 2011) 10'

<script type="text/javascript" src="//e.issuu.com/embed.js" async="true"></script>

<div class="notice">
  <h4>Program Note</h4>
  <p><i>intimate stream[s]</i>  was inspired by ideas from Gestalt psychology and the psychoacoustical model of auditory streams, especially by the work of psychologist Albert Bregman. In theory, the study of auditory stream segregation deals with principles of organization of sound into perceptually coherent structures. In my composition, the idea portrays a single harmonic stream comprised of multiple melodic lines whose individual parts move from harmonicity to inharmonicity, resulting in the harmonic motion between tonal stability and instability.</p>

  <p>This conceptual process enhances the musical flux and controls the varied statements of a single harmonic object. In turn, timbral variations not only enhance the melodic/harmonic contour of consonance and dissonance, but they also form an impression of evolving harmonic envelopes whose dynamic curves accompany time-varying contrapuntal arabesques. The harmonic language in the piece reflects the beginning of my research in a personal harmonic grammar inspired by cognitive attributes of sound as a metaphor for musical syntax.</p>

  <p>This string quartet also belongs to a group of my works in which I explore the interaction and reciprocity of consonance and dissonance and the uniformity and uniqueness of musical design as a direct narrative tool for portraying the musically sublime, best defined as simultaneity of tension and repose, and structural circularity and irresolvability, respectively.</p>
