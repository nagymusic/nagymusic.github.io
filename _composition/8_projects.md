## Dialogues with Silence
Baritone, flute, percussion, multimedia (in progress) c. 40'

### Project Description
<div class="notice">
  <h4></h4>
  <p>As a recipient of the Duquesne University's 2017 Paluse Faculty Research Grant, I'm composing a new musical composition based on prayers and drawings from <i>Dialogues with Silence</i> (2001), a book by Catholic priest and Trappist monk, Thomas Merton (1915—1968).</p>

  <p>In an effort to explore the role of the sacred in the search for common good, in composing my new musical composition I would consider Merton's concept of silence as a contemplative agent for social change in our world. This necessity for inner reflection would be a guiding principle in the selection of texts and drawings to be featured in the composition, thus supporting the university’s concern for moral and spiritual values, as well as its attentiveness to social and global concerns.</p>

  <p>Scored for baritone voice, flute, percussion, and electronics, the new 40-minute work sets a selection of Merton’s texts and drawings to music. It is enhanced by electronically manipulated sounds that act as a sonic backdrop to the selected drawings displayed during the performance. The new composition will be completed in Winter 2018, and subsequently premiered in Spring 2019 at the Genesius Theatre at Duquesne University.
