  <h4>Program Note</h4>
  <p><i>Cantabilamente</i> takes its title and musical material from a fragment of glagolitic chant from the Island of Hvar in Croatia. Known as a unique collection of folk melodies intended as religious lamentations, the glagolitic chant offers a particular type of musical material suggestive of contemplative musical space. The piece begins and ends with a prologue and epilogue that unfolds a litany of melodic iterations. This process suggests a ritual-like structure whereby the ensuing presentation of musical material embodies a procession-like experience comprised of the continuous transformations of orchestral textures and instrumental colors. The transparent overtones of lament coalesce into the resonance of emotional intensity, ranging from the dark and expressive sustained lines, opaque and suspended at times, to the bright and solemn exuberance of the dense sonorities.</p>

  <h4>Program Note</h4>
  <p><i>Cord[echo]es</i> is a ritual-like, ceremonial concerto for violin and chamber orchestra based on Bach’s <i>Chaconne</i> in d minor from Partita no. 2 for solo violin, BWV 1004. The piece is based on a continuous process of gradual transformation from a significantly modified manifestations of Bach’s chaconne to its brief quotation in the cadenza. The form of the concerto can best be described as a spiral: the prologue and epilogue that open and close the work enclose the reinstatements (commentaries and couplets) of the two contrasting sections that unfold and move the music forward.</p>

<div class="notice">
  <h4>Program Note</h4>
  <p>As a sinfonia concertante for organ, string orchestra, harp, and timpani, <i>Qualia</i> takes as inspiration the notion of our inner sense perceptions, also known as 'qualia,' a term used in the philosophy and psychology of to allude to discrete instances and qualities of conscious awareness, emotion, and experience. Envisioned as an organ concerto, <i>Qualia</i> is a musical representation of introspective affective states reflected through a dynamic array of evocative harmonies, melodies, rhythms, and textures.</p>

<div class="notice">
  <h4>Program Note</h4>
  <p><i>Angel Antiphons</i> was composed in honor of Benjamin Britten's birth centenary (1913-2013).The work can best be described as a joyous celebration of life and music. The musical material, which consists of two contrasting ideas, propels the spiral-like form whose formal and structural framework reveals ceremonial and ritual-like sections on one end, and more fluid and exuberant ones, on the other. The slower sections in the piece elaborate on a short melodic fragment taken from Britten's anthem for mixed choir and organ, <i>Antiphon</i>, composed in 1956.</p>

## Suizen
Symphonic evocation for shakuhachi flute and orchestra (2-2-2-2, 2-2-2-1, timp, perc(3), hp, shak. fl, strings)
(2012) 9'

<div data-configid="9835853/10551589" style="width:100%; height:250px;" class="issuuembed"></div>
<script type="text/javascript" src="//e.issuu.com/embed.js" async="true"></script>

<div class="notice">
  <h4>Program Note</h4>
  <p>Influenced by traditional Asian religious practices and music performance, this evocation for shakuhachi and orchestra is inspired by ‘suizen’ — a blowing meditation; suizen is known as a form of Zen practice characterized by the ritual of playing the shakuhachi bamboo flute (a Japanese end-blown flute) as a means of achieving a state of self-realization. <i>Suizen</i> may be best described as a tone poem for orchestra — a sound image of the moments of inner reflection and musical experience. The instrumentation enhances this experience whereby the oscillations of harmonies, melodies, and rhythms resemble one’s breathing – the experience suggested in the opening and closing sections of the work.</p>
  <p><i>Suizen</i> received the 2011 Seattle Symphony Composition Prize "Celebrate Asia Festival."</p>
