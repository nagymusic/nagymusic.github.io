## Migrant Angels
Soprano and Electronics (In Progress) c. 30

<div class="notice">
  <h4>Program Note</h4>
  <p>
  In this work, I set to music a collection of poems by Charles McCollester. The selected poems depict the four angels from <a href="https://vankamurals.org/mural-detail/">Maxo Vanka's murals</a> at St. Nicholas Church in Pittsburgh, Pennyslvania: <i>Justice, Injustice, Mati (Mother),</i> and <i>Prudence</i>.

 A long-time supporter and contributor to the preservation of Vanka’s murals, Dr. Charles McCollester has written and lectured on Vanka's murals and artistic legacy. My new song cycle emphasizes the complicated yet hopeful realities of migration within which the American immigrant experiences have been shared, reworked, claimed, and disavowed in the current socio-political climate. In composing my new work, I seek to address the themes portrayed in Vanka’s murals and McCollister's poems, particularly those of migration and social integration. By exploring those themes through musical and artistic lenses, I hope to create a multi-layered work whose musical gestures and the narrative unfolds as a series of musical canvases. The lyrics associated with the murals also play an essential role in the musical design of my new work. In the treatment of the lyrics, I use the words to determine the shape of music in all details, large and small. For example, I intend to explore different ways in which text can be translated into numerical sequences and how these sequences can be transformed into musical materials. This approach to musical structure and form allows me to also focus on the design and implementation of computer interfaces for the electronic sounds, making an even stronger connection among the poetry, artwork, and media.

## cantusesquisse
sound installation (2019) 8'

<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/703245067&color=%23b5b4ac&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true"></iframe>

  <h4>Program Note</h4>
  <p><i>cantusesquisse</i> features a series of processed and synthesized sound samples that originated in a short melodic chant-like audio sample. The result is a multilayered ambient stream of sound that while at times meditative, it invites the listener to enter into the sound itself by experiencing the unfolding of different sonic paths.</p>

## Dialogues with Silence
Flute, baritone, percussion and multimedia (2019) 60'

  <h4>Program Note</h4>
  <p>As a recipient of the Duquesne University's 2017 Paluse Faculty Research Grant, I composed a new musical composition based on prayers and drawings from <i>Dialogues with Silence</i> (2001), a book by a Catholic priest and Trappist monk, Thomas Merton (1915—1968).</p>

  <p>To explore the role of the sacred in the search for the common good, in composing my new musical composition I considered Merton's concept of silence as a contemplative agent for social change in our world. This necessity for inner reflection would be a guiding principle in the selection of texts and drawings to be featured in the composition, thus supporting the university’s concern for moral and spiritual values, as well as its attentiveness to social and global concerns.</p>

  <p>Scored for baritone voice, flute, percussion, and electronics, the new 40-minute work sets a selection of Merton’s texts and drawings to music. It is enhanced by electronically manipulated sounds that act as a sonic backdrop to the selected drawings displayed during the performance. The new composition was premiered in Spring 2019 at the Genesius Theatre at Duquesne University.

## Concealments
Five pieces for multimedia (2017) 11'

<iframe width="725" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T4oZZ0SY5i8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<div class="notice">
  <h4>Program Note</h4>
  <p>Based on the encaustic handmade paper laminate artwork <i>Concealment Series</i> by Haley Nagy. Similar to “the fusion of encaustic and hand papermaking used to explore the idea of the ‘hidden,'” <i>Concealments</i> is a sound art piece explores the fusion of cultural forms emanating from the reciprocity of visual and sound arts. In this interdisciplinary collaborative project, I wanted to learn from the artist’s creative practice about how to approach texture of sound, and relate information about visual appearance in a musical work.</p>

 <p>I. Unveil <i>very fast, becoming translucent</i></p>
 <p>II. Reveal <i>calm, moving, pliable</i></p>
 <p>III. Conceal <i>very slow, evaporating</i></p>
 <p>IV. Apparent <i>exuberant and free, gradually receding</i></p>
 <p>V. Veil <i>very fast, becoming opaque</i></p>

## Inner Self II
Three clarinets and electronics (2015) 9'

<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/479796189&color=%234880ae&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe>

<div class="notice">
  <h4>Program Note</h4>
  <p>In <i>Inner Self II</i>, Nagy injects a new level of discipline into his quest for color. The interweaving patterns of strict contrapuntal imitation in this spiral canon unfold in diatonic purity throughout, creating an untroubled flow that invites us to pay fresh attention to each new juxtaposition of tones. Through the almost scientific process of canon, Nagy rediscovers and reassesses the intervals in the diatonic collection for their coloristic potential. (Benjamin Binder).</p>

  <p>At times the electronic sounds extend the clarinet resonance; at other times the electronic part creates contrapuntal textures that complement the unfolding of the three-part canon in the clarinet part. This work is a sequel to <i>Canon-Inner Self</i> (2007) for piano solo.</p>

<div class="notice">
  <h4>Program Note</h4>
  <p>Scored as a triptych, <i>Kaleidoscope</i> depicts self-sustaining musical transformations that coalesce into fluid, constantly evolving, mirage-like structures. Recursive patterns of harmonies and emerging melodies, along with the interactive contrapuntal symmetries between the instruments, suggest the refractory patterns of light formed by mirrors containing pieces of colored glass, such as those found in a kaleidoscope. This can be heard where patterns of musical shapes emerge that invite the listener to enter an Escher-like musical space.</p>

  <p><i>Kaleidoscope</i> was commissioned by Elisa Elisa Järvi and Andrea Kiefer.</p>

## And so she said II
Sound installation (2013) 8'

<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/482093883&color=%234880ae&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe>

<div class="notice">
  <h4>Program Note</h4>
  <p>In this sound installation, I used a recording of my wife's voice, whose vocal attributes were analyzed and transformed into a gradually evolving sonic canvas. Considering her short speech utterance to be the main sound object or leitmotif, I created a series of musical transformations of the original sound. This resulted in both a melodic and harmonic evolution of sound textures, where the transformations processes influenced a more polyphonic treatment of the material. The resulting design of the work may reassemble a spiral in which each consecutive transformation resound the vocal qualities of the voice, becoming multi-layered and intricate by each turn. <i>And so she said... II</i> is a sequel to a short piano piece composed after the spectral analysis of the sound material.</p>

  <h4>Program Note</h4>
  <p>As one of five composers who were invited to compete in person, I was assigned in the morning of the event an instrumentation and a “secret ingredient” for a to-be-composed musical work: a pipe organ as a designed instrumentation and music box as a secret ingredient. I had only five hours to write a new piece, which was then performed and judged by a panel of professional musicians and critics in a public concert that same evening.</p>

  <p>My work for organ and music box entitled _Vox Reginæ Organalis_ was premiered by the Baldwin-Wallace organist Jonathan William Moyer and broadcasted live on WCLV 104.9 FM. Below you can listen the interview and the performance of _Vox Reginæ Organalis_ for pipe organ and music box.</p>
