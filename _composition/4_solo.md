  <h4>Program Note</h4>
  <p> Ethereal in spirit, this features slowly changing harmonies with a haunting melody that fades in and out.</p>

  <p>"'Prayer' (2007, rev. 2011) is a short work inspired by Philippians 4:13: “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.” It is a musical exploration of some of the same musical material that is revisited at greater length in the latter work, 'Preludes for a Prayer.''" <i>Carson Cooman</i> - PARMA Recordings CD Liner Notes</p>

  <h4>Program Note</h4>
  <p>Composed as a study for solo clarinet, <i>[a]new</i> translates Gertrude Stein's poem <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/47968/new"><i>new</i></a> to music. By systematically mapping the ascii letter characters from every word in the poem to musical strcture, every line from the poem becomes a phrase, resulting in modal and metric structures that emerge from the text itself.</p>

<div class="notice">
  <h4>Program Note</h4>
  <p>Composed in three sections, "Angelus" gradually unfolds a simple phrase schema consisting of a few chords, that albeit similar in construction, create a transformative musical space. In a vocalize-like manner, the resulting melodies further support this harmonic design, conveying a sense of mystery.</p>

  <p>"'Angelus' is a quiet and atmospheric piece with overt minimalist influences. The Angelus is one of the significant Catholic devotions, and traditionally this call to prayer would be evoked by the ringing of a bell. In the music, one can hear the gently tolling, repeating patterns change gradually throughout." <i>Carson Cooman</i> - PARMA Recordings CD Liner Notes</p>

<div class="notice">
  <h4>Program Note</h4>
  <p>Characterized by a fantasy-like, rhapsodic narrative, <i>Ricercar dell'affinità</i> employs several compositional techniques derived from the composer’s exploration of the perceptual affinity of tones. The processual musical objects are distinguished by unique timbres and textures, in turn suggesting a musical and procedural affinity produced by gradual transformations of the tonal and metric structure. Following a short, improvisatory prologue, the piece unfolds in two contrasting sections, with the first one featuring a two-part, systematically permutative cyclical counterpoint of rapid florid gestures, and the second displaying more melodically and harmonically linear material.</p>

  <h4>Program Note</h4>
  <p><i>Preludes for a Prayer</i> is the largest of the organ works on the album and unfolds across seven movements. The seventh movement is a more extended version of the first movement, and the inner five movements travel through largely contemplative landscapes, with contrasts of pattern in texture. Spirited music bursts forth briefly in the sixth movement and then dissolves again in the exquisitely tranquil finale, which moves slowly towards its satisfying final cadence and a sense of closure.

  <h4>Program Note</h4>
  <p>The <i>Two Canons</i>—“Inner Self” (2007, rev. 2010) and “Carmen Perpetuum” (Perpetual Song) (2007, rev. 2017)—explore basic canonic principles in service of building something that is rather more complex than straightforward imitation. “Inner Self” is a trio in three different registers. In “Carmen Perpetuum,” the voices sustain and are blurred into thick harmonies in the manuals; the theme in the pedals moves below it at a slower pace. (Notes by Carson Cooman, PARMA Recordings)</p>

<div class="notice">
  <h4>Program Note</h4>
  <p>These three etudes were inspired by the composer's walks by the shores of Lake Michigan in Chicago's Rogers Park. Here Nagy derives harmonic configurations from his "sonance modes," a carefully mapped-out hierarchy of pitch constructs based on cognitive research into the perceptual affinity to tones. <i>of the lake I</i> (2007, rev. 2014) begins with a single musical line, a series of rising fifths. Just as the pattern seems to become predictable, another line enters the music, rubbing dissonantly against the first - a raindrop of the lake, perhaps, whose ripples now expand in a new direction, responding to new raindrops, forming new ripples. A consistent rhythmic pattern materializes from the intersecting lines, seducing the listener into the sensation of some sort of postminimalist groove, but only temporarily - soon those expectations evaporate, and other grooves fade in, just as in the movement of nature we cannot help but perceive a reflection of our own psychological habits and tendencies. The music's objectivity initially turns us back on ourselves, but if we continue to listen closely, we will find ourselves encouraged to return to the sounds themselves, and the underlying peace behind all of the movement may reval itself to us. The first etude ends on its way out, Ligeti-like, pointing toward the infinite expansion of the pattern beyond the edge of the keyboard. The sonance series is used to similar effect in the the etude's two sequels: in <i>of the lake II</i> (2011), it produces a glittering surface of light, dancing waves, while <i>of the lake III</i> (2014) throws us immediately into a strong undertow and gradually brings us back to the shore. (Notes by Benjamin Binder, MSR Classics)</p>

  <p>In <i>Vestiges</i>, a work based on an untitled poem by the composer, Nagy uses spectral compositional techniques in earnest, applying a computer-generated series of compression and expansion procedures to the constituent intervals of the harmonic series on B-flat.
