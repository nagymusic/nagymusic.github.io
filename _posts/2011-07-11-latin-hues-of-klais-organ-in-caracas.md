A 3-manual and pedal mechanical action instrument by Orgelbau Klais from Bonn, Germany, sits comfortably and commandingly at the Simón Bolívar Concert Hall in Caracas, Venezuela. I had a great opportunity to play the organ during my recent visit to Caracas. The glittering case reflects the colorful and inviting performance space - a part of the [Center for Social Action Through Music][performance_center_caracas], designed by the Venezuelan architect, Tomás Lugo. Music thrives in this place, led by a passionate group of fantastic musicians and of course, imbued with the enthusiasm of the country's very own, Gustavo Dudamel.

The organ stop-list reveals the Spanish influence with the indispensable set of horizontally mounted high-pressured _Trompeta de Batalla_. My favorite two were _Gamba_ and _Voz Celeste_, while harmonically lush and and delightfully stringy, would only resonate more mysteriously if placed in a large reverb-prone edifice of some sacred affiliation. Visit the builder's [website][klais_caracas] for more information on this amazing instrument.

Words of gratitude to maestro Pablo Catellanos for introducing me to such a remarkable instrument.
