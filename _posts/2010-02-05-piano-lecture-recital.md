Family Piano Co. of Waukegan, IL, has invited me to their piano showroom to perform on their featured Sauter grand piano as part of their concert series. My great love for the exquisite [Sauter][sauter] pianos dates back to my student days in Paris where I had an opportunity to discover their unique tonal palette. The lecture-recital will consisted of a discussion and performance of the twentieth- and twenty-firts century piano music, including the performance my new piano work, _Concealments_, a collaboration with the artist, [Haley Nagy][haley_nagy]. The event will take place on January 31 at 4 pm at Family Pianos in Waukegen.
