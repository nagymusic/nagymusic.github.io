Organized by the Composers' Association of Serbia, my work for solo organ, _Angelus_ (2018), will receive the European premiere during [International Review of Composers][tribina] in Belgrade. The work will be performed on by the organist Maja Smiljanić Radić on October 5, 2019 at the Cathedral of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Belgrade.
