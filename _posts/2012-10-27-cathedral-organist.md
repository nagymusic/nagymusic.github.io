This fall I begin my tenure as the Cathedral Organist at [St. Joseph Cathedral][st_joseph_wheeling], Wheeling, West Virginia. The Cathedral is an exquisite example of the Lombardy Romanesque architecture; it hosts two pipe organs: a three-manual Casavant Organ and a one-manual antiphonal Kilgen in the chancel.
