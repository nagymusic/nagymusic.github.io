My study of musical creativity in composition and performance has been published in Creativity Research Journal. The article entitled,[_The Apperception of Musical Creativity: Performance as Ritual, Composition as Self-Realization_][creativity_research_journal_article], develops a theory of the apperception of musical creativity in performance and composition using the notions of ritual and self-realization as mutually inclusive idiosyncrasies of musical experience.
