The 4th River Music Project is a collective of Duquesne University composers and performers dedicated to presenting new music with a twist. Inspired by the fourth river in Pittsburgh that runs underground and rises up through the fountain at the Point, the 4th River Project is committed to exploring alternative instruments, new forms of interactive performance styles and the use of multimedia as part of the gestalt of making music today.

The premiere concert will take place on Thursday, December 6, 8 pm at the Mary Pappert School of Music, Duquesne University. A part of the residency concerts of the Pittsburgh Symphony Composer of the Year series, the concert will feature Ben Opie on saxophone and interactive computer electronics on Edmund Campion’s Corail as well as works by Mason Bates, Anna Clyne, and Duquesne music faculty. The concert will focus on electro-acoustic pieces with multimedia elements.
