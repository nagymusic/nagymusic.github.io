Last fall, on a rainy Saturday evening, I had a unique opportunity to play the Messiaen's venerable pipe organ at [Eglise de la Trinite][trinite_paris] in Paris. It was not only touching the very keys that Messiaen played that made the experience rather surreal, but hearing the enveloping sound resonating from the instrument into the space that had inspired him for so many years was indeed truly inspiring.

Special thanks to [Jean-François Hatton][hatton] for his kind hospitality and welcome at La Trinité.
