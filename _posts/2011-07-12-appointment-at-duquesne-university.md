I am happy to announce that I have been appointed as Assistant Professor of Music at [Duquesne University][duq] in Pittsburgh, PA. This Fall I will be joining the Musicianship Department at the Mary Pappert [School of Music][duq_music] where I will be teaching a forward-looking music theory curriculum that integrates harmony, counterpoint, form, and analysis with aural and keyboard skills, composition, and improvisation. I believe that Duquesne University is a wonderful place to pursue my creative and scholarly work. I very much look forward to meeting the students and learning more about their music, talents, and aspirations.
