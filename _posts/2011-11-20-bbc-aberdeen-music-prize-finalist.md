As a result of the call for scores competition co-organized by the University of Aberdeen and the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, I was short listed for the 2011 BBC/Aberdeen Music Prize. With entries from Japan, Argentina, Australia, Russia, and the United States, this composition competition proved to be of international scope and at an exceptionally high standard. From over 300 submissions, my piece for trumpet and string quartet, _Ayres_, had been chosen as one of the five compositions to be premiered by the members of the BBC Symphony Orchestra of Scotland in Fall 2011. As a competition finalist, I was invited to visit the University of Aberdeen and attend the Music Prize Weekend in November 2011 for a series of performances and workshops led by the British composer Julian Anderson and musicians from the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra.

Inspired by the poetry attributed to the English Renaissance poet and musician, John Dowland (1563-1626), _Ayres_ will receive its European premiere performance at the University of Aberdeen by the by the musicians from the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra Mark Oâ€™Keefe (trumpet), Amy Cardigan & Alastair Savage (violins), Andrew Berridge (viola), Anne Brincourt (cello).
