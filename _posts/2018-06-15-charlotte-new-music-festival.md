My new string quartet, _Anima Anim√¶_, commissioned by the [Charlotte New Music Festival][charlotte-festival], was workshopped and premiered by the [Beo String Quartet][beo-quartet] during the festival at Queens University in Charlotte, New Carolina. The premiere performance was on June 29, 2018 at Free Range Brewing performance space in Charlotte.

The members of the Beo String Quartet also premiered my piece _humbl[y]_, a short work for two violins and viola composed in response to the festival speed-writing contest. Following the performance, the work was slected by the audience as the best-in-show.
