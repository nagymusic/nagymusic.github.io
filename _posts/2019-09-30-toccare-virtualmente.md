{% include gallery caption="Yamaha Disklavier Composition Competition Award Ceremony." %}

My new composition for Disklavier, _Toccare Virtualmente_, was awarded the first prize in the Cremona Musica Yamaha [Disklavier Composers Contest][disklavier_composers_contest] in Cremona, Italy. Selected among 40 composers from Italy, Japan, Australia, and the United States, and featured as one of the 5 finalists, I received a new Yamaha DU1 Enspire ST upright piano with Disklavier technology. The score of my piece is published by Edizioni Curci music publishing house from Milan, Italy.
