I am the recipient of the 2011 Iron Composer Prize at the Iron Composer composition. The contest took place on September 16, 2011 at Baldwin Wallace Unniversity in Berea, Ohio. As one of five composers who were invited to compete in person, I was assigned in the morning of the event an instrumentation and a “secret ingredient” for a to-be-composed musical work: a pipe organ as a designed instrumentation and music box as a secret ingredient. I had only five hours to write a new piece, which was then performed and judged by a panel of professional musicians and critics in a public concert that same evening.

My work for organ and music box entitled _Vox Reginæ Organalis_ was premiered by the Baldwin-Wallace organist Jonathan William Moyer and broadcasted live on WCLV 104.9 FM. Below you can listen the interview and the performance of _Vox Reginæ Organalis_ for pipe organ and music box. Listen to the interview and peformance [here][nagy_vox_reginae_interviewperformance].
