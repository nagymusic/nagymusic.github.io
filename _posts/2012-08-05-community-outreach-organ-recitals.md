This fall I will embark on a series of community outreach organ recitals in the Pittsburgh and Chicago area. The hour-long recitals will feature organ repertoire inspired by prayer, meditation, and reflection. I believe that music can help us apperceive the sense of our inner being as well as encounter the divine in some beautifully mysterious ways. The pipe organ, with its wide array of sound colors, seems to be the perfect vehicle for this experience. The organ recitals are intended as my gift to the community; donations or free will offerings will go to support the music program of the venue where the concert is taking place.
