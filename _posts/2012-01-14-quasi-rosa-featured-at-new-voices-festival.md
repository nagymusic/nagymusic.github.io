The [New Voices @ CUA][new_voices_festival], an annual festival of new music took place on January 20 and 21, 2012 at the [Catholic University of America][cua] in Washington, DC. This is an invitation to everyone to attend this exciting two day festival of new vocal music.

I would like to thank Kat Acosta and Jay Parrotta for preparing my work for soprano and organ, _Quasi Rosa_, which was performed on Saturday, January 21 at 10 am, at St. Vncent de Paul Chapel on the campus of the Catholic University of America in Washington D.C.
