I am very thankful to Duquesne University string players for their performance and recording of my string quartet, _Intimate Streams_. The piece reflects my ongoing exploration of musical syntax as an interplay of music cognition and philosophy, notably of the creation and perception of musical harmony-timbre(s) and the causality and notion of musically sublime.
