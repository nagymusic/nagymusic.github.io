The First Readings Project is a professional chamber choir founded by its director, J. David Moore, to assist composers in the development of new music for vocal ensemble. The group presents a series of public readings of new works and works-in-progress, and also offers its services for recordings and workshops to individuals and institutions.

Special thanks to [J. David Moore][david_moore] for preparing the piece and for his valuable feedback.
