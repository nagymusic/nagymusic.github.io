My new work for cello and piano, _Angel Annunciation_, was selected as one of six works to be recorded in the 2012 [Cleveland Composer's Recording Institute][ccri_2012] at Cleveland State University, on July 16-20, 2012. As an invited composer, I had a great privilege meeting fellow composers, great performers, and experience a high quality recording process of my new work. 

Special thanks to [David Russell][david_russell] (cello) and [Geoffrey Burleson][geoffrey_burleson] (piano) for learning the piece and their marvelous performance. Words of gratitude to [Andrew Rindfleisch][andrew_rindfleisch], the institute director, and David Yost, recording engineer, for all their patience, guidance, and suggestions.

The recording institute is a weeklong workshop in which all featured composition are rehearsed by the resident music ensemble and then produced in a series of recording sessions. Each participant takes an active part in rehearsals, recording sessions, and forum presentations of their works.
