The music tradition is nurtured conspicuously in South America, and no other region that is truly leaving us often impressed by the talent and musicality is none other than Venezuela, where the music forms an integral part of the society. Venezuelan music scene has been conditioned and nurtured partly by the society itself, and now of course it flourishes spectacularly under the auspices of [El Sistema][el_sistema] - a publicly financed music education program, a government foundation that oversees more than hundred of Venezuelan orchestras and music education programs.

In early June of 2011 I had the privilege of being invited to visit the music department at [Simon Bolivar University][simon_bolivar_university] in Venezuela, a few miles outside of Caracas - a magnificent place for creative work and research - where lush vegetation provides just enough seclusion from otherwise very busy and high-energy capital. In addition to a lecture and presentation of my works at the graduate music department, I had a wonderful opportunity to learn more about the contemporary music scene in Venezuela and meet several very talented young composers in the composition master class. A very high level of students, great enthusiasm and support of the faculty, and above all - sincere musicality, are the traces that describe an aspirational department of composition on campus of Simon Bolivar University in Caracas - a magnificent retreat for music contemplation, creation, and performance.

I would like to express my gratitude to Dr. [Diana Arismendi][diana_arismendi], Dr. [Adina Izarra][adina_izarra], and Prof. [Eduardo Lecuna][eduardo_lecuna], for extending their kind invitation.
