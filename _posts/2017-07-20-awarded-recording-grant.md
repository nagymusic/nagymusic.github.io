I am a recipient of the 2017 Investing in Professional Artists grant offered in partnership by The Pittsburgh Foundation and The Heinz Endowments. The grant will be used to cover the recording of a solo CD album featuring my compositions for pipe organ. I plan to perform and record the pieces on the new <a href="http://jaeckelorgans.com/organs/opus-55/">Jaeckel organ</a> in Duquesne University's Chapel. The CD album will be released by <a href="http://www.parmarecordings.com/">PARMA Recordings</a> in late 2017. The foundation received 113 proposals from individuals and organizations in 17 cities and towns throughout the region. Peer panels comprised of regional and national experts reviewed each proposal in depth and recommended 13 proposals for funding.
