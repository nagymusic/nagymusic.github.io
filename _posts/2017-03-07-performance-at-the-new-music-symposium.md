My composition for solo flute, Ricercar dell'affinità (2015), received the US premiere at the 2017 <a href="http://www.robbtrust.org/events/2017-46th-annual-john-donald-robb-composers-symposium">John Donald Robb Composers' Symposium</a> at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque (March 26-30, 2017). The symposium featured daily concerts, panels, and presentations on contemporary music.

Characterized by a fantasy-like, rhapsodic narrative, <em>Ricercar dell'affinità</em> employs several compositional techniques derived from the composer’s exploration of the perceptual affinity of tones. The processual musical objects are distinguished by unique timbres and textures, in turn suggesting a musical and procedural affinity produced by gradual transformations of the tonal and metric structure. Following a short, improvisatory prologue, the piece unfolds in two contrasting sections, with the first one featuring a two-part, cyclical counterpoint of rapid florid gestures, and the second displaying more melodically and harmonically linear material.
