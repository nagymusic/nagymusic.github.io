I am pleased to announce that I will be teaching a new course at Duquesne University in Spring 2015. In this graduate and advanced undergraduate seminar, I plan to survey the multi-disciplinary perspectives on musical creativity in composition, performance, listening, and pedagogy of music.

#### Course Description

This course surveys the multi-disciplinary perspectives on musical creativity in composition, performance, appreciation, and teaching of music. Musical creativity is considered to be a personal, internal activity that results in new musical _representations_ (i.e., inner hearing and imagery) and _manifestations_ (i.e., completed composition and performance). The course explores the research and findings that studies in music psychology, cognitive science,  music theory, musicology, education, and performance have produced, together with their implications on the multimodality of creative experience in music. This perspective allows for a larger contextual relationship for the critical analysis of musical creativity. Exploring the correlation of the physical and mental activities of music, this course redefines the notion of musical creativity by proposing a pragmatic relationship between creation, reproduction, and perception of music. The course also investigates creativity in music education as it reviews the pedagogical frameworks employed in the creative musical arts. The course will result in research projects followed by student forum presentations.
