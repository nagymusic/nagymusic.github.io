I have been chosen as the winner of [The Brass Project][brass_project] ensemble call for proposals to compose a new work for brass sextet. The new composition will receive the premiere by The Brass Project ensemble in New York City during the 2020/2021 season.

Exploring issues of immigration and the American dream, in composing the work I will turn for inspiration to [_The New Colossus_][new_colossus], a poem by Emma Lazarus (1849-1887), which is engraved on the base of the Statue of Liberty. 

> Give me your tired, your poor,
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,
I lift my lamp beside the golden door!
