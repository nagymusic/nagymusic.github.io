[St. Michael in Old Town Church][st_mikes] is home to one the few remaining Kilgen pipe organs in the city. The Kilgen Organ Company was one the most famous organ manufacturers in the late 1800's, and was especially known for the quality of its church pipe organs -- in fact it produced the great organ at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City. Interested in raising awareness in the community of this rare type of pipe organ, the St. Michael's parish community has undertaken a restoration of the pipe organ to its full musical potential. To that end, the church has also launched a series: Old Town Organ Vespers, and its next scheduled performance is Saturday, May 7, 2011.
