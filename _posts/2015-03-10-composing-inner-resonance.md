### Composing Inner Resonance: Contemporary Musical Settings of the Passion

[Catholic Artistic Imagination Series][catolic-artistic-imagination-passion], Duquesne University
March 16, 2015

4:00 -5:30 PM  Africa Room (Student Union)
Presenter: Zvonimir Nagy

The accounts of the Holy Week Gospel narratives have inspired composers throughout music history to set the narrative of Christ's Passion to music. From cross-cultural and cross-denominational perspectives, the presentation will unveil a selection of more recent Passion music by present day composers. The discussion will offer a window into the composers' creative world as it arranges a moderated dialogue between the sense of the composer's musical representations and music's ultimate manifestations at the crossroads of tradition and innovation.

Faculty, staff, and graduate students are welcome to attend. Space is limited. 
Please RSVP by emailing Judi O'Brien <obrienj3@duq.edu> at The Center for the Catholic Intellectual Tradition. Phone: (412) 396.1595.
