Premiere of _Dialogues with Silence_ at the Genesius Theatre at Duquesne Univerity. Scored for flute, baritone, percussion and multimedia, the work is inspired by a selection of poems and drawings by Thomas Merton.

The composition and performance of this work is supported by the Duquesne University Paluse Faculty Research Grant. The premiere performance is presented as a part of the [Catholic Artistic Imagination][CAI] series at the [Center for Catholic Faith and Culture][CCFC].

Thomas Merton was a prolific author and social activist who championed spirituality, civil rights and peace. The project can be described as a series of musical and spiritual dialogues that are informed by faith and infused with human creativity, and situated between the silence of our innermost being, and the sound and our humanity.
