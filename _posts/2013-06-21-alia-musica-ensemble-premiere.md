Commissioned by the [Alia Musica Ensemble][alia_musica] for the second annual Conductors Festival, a new work for chamber orchestra, Angel Antiphons, received the world premiere on September 13, 2013, directed by Walter Morales. The performance took place at PNC Recital Hall at Duquesne University.

_Angel Antiphons_ was composed in honor of Benjamin Britten's birth centenary (1913-2013).The work can best be described as a joyous celebration of life and music. The musical material, which consists of two contrasting ideas, propels the spiral-like form whose formal and structural framework reveals ceremonial and ritual-like sections on one end, and more fluid and exuberant ones, on the other. The slower sections in the piece elaborate on a short melodic fragment taken from Britten's anthem for mixed choir and organ, _Antiphon_, composed in 1956.
