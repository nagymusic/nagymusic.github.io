The Cleveland Composerâ€™s Recording Institute at Cleveland State University offers a workshop dedicated to the studio recording production of new works to a selected group of composers. Each composer in the Institute has a unique opportunity to have a work rehearsed by Cleveland Contemporary Players -- the resident professional ensemble, then recorded and produced in a two-hour long recording session. Composers are invited to the studio recording sessions to study the process and challenges of commercial level recording production and actively assist the recording production of their compositions.
