Zvonimir Nagy (organ) and Edward Kocher (trombone) of Duquesne University.

[Beckerath Organ][beckerath_st_paul] (restored by Taylor & Boody)

The recital features organ and trombone repertoire inspired by prayer and meditation.  Music can help us apperceive the sense of our inner being as well as encounter the divine in some beautifully mysterious ways.  The pipe organ, with its wide array of sound colors, seems to be the perfect vehicle for this experience.

The nature of musical performance can also be appreciated as musical ritual, in terms of an induced _spiritual_ ethos, rather than a mere execution of idiomatically constructed musical sequences. As a composer and organist, I investigate the notion of the religious in musical performance as experienced by both the performer and listener. As a result, the introspective setting of the presented repertoire invites one to contemplate the structure and meaning of prayer through sound, as portrayed by musical themes and gestures.

As incense rises, the recital unfolds like a spiral from the compositions written in the present day towards Franck’s monumental _Prière_, when it folds back almost where it has started.
