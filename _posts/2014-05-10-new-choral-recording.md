The [First Readings Project][frp] choral ensemble under the direction of J. David Moore recently recorded a choral work entitled _Caritas_ ("Love"). Composed in 2007 and revised in early 2014, this piece for unaccompanied SATB choir is based on the text from Hildegard of Bingen's _Antiphon of the Holy Spirit_ taken from “Symphonia Armonie Celestium Revelationum.”

#### Caritas

Caritas
habundat in omnia,
de imis excellentissima super sidera
atque amantissima in omnia, quia summo regi osculum
pacis dedit.

Love
abounds in all,
most exalted from the depths above the stars
and most loving in all,
for she has given the high king the kiss of peace.
